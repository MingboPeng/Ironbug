# AirTerminalSingleDuctConstantVolumeReheat

`AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:Reheat`
```
The AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:Reheat or terminal reheat system is a constant volume reheat system. The systems cooling capabilities are provided by way of cooling coil that supplies cooling to the entire supply air volume. The cooling coil is controlled by a controller setpoint specified for the cooling coil. Zone control is accomplished by heating (reheating) the airflow into each zone as determined by the zone thermostat. Currently the reheat can be supplied by a electric, gas, or hot water coil that tries to meet the zone demand.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
Unique name for the terminal reheat Air Distribution Unit (ADU).
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
Schedule that this component will operate or is available to operate. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the component can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the component must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName
```
The outlet node from the ADU to the zone. This is the same node as the reheat component air outlet node.
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
The air-inlet node name that connects the air splitter to the individual zone ADU. This is the same node as the reheat component air inlet node.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Air Flow Rate 
MaximumAirFlowRate
```
The design constant volume flow rate (m^{3}/sec) specified for the terminal reheat ADU.
```
	
##  Field: Reheat Coil Object Type 
ReheatCoilObjectType
```
The valid reheat component objects currently available are:
  {Coil:Heating:Water}
  {Coil:Heating:Electric}
  {Coil:Heating:Fuel}
  {Coil:Heating:Steam}
```
	
##  Field: Reheat Coil Name 
ReheatCoilName
```
Reheat Coil Object name being simulated with this ADU. Applicable for all coils.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate 
MaximumHotWaterOrSteamFlowRate
```
This field is zero for gas and electric coils. Set to the maximum design hot water or steam volumetric flow rate in m^{3}/s for the hot water or steam heating coil. The steam volumetric~ flow rate is calculated at 100C and 101325 Pa.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate 
MinimumHotWaterOrSteamFlowRate
```
This field is zero for gas and electric coils. Set to the minimum design hot water or steam volumetric flow rate in m^{3}/s for the hot water or steam coil, normally set to be a shut off valve that is set to zero. The steam volumetric~ flow rate is calculated at 100C and 101325 Pa.
```
	
##  Field: Convergence Tolerance 
ConvergenceTolerance
```
The coil is controlled by knowing the zone demand determined by the zone thermostat and setting the outlet conditions to meet this demand. For the electric and gas coils, this is set exactly since the coil model solution can be inverted. With the hot water coil that uses an effectiveness-NTU method, the solution cannot be inverted directly. Therefore, to determine the correct mass flow rate for the hot water the solution is solved for by iteration. The iterative solution uses an interval halving routine and needs a termination criterion that is set with the Convergence Tolerance parameter. This control offset is set to a decimal fraction of the zone demand as the criteria, i.e.~0.001. The default for the field is 0.001.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Reheat Air Temperature 
MaximumReheatAirTemperature
```
This is the upper limit on the temperature in degrees C of the air leaving the terminal unit -- reheat coil (and being delivered to the zone). If the user leaves this field blank, no maximum reheat air temperature is enforced.
```
	
# AirTerminalSingleDuctConstantVolumeNoReheat

`AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:NoReheat`
```
The AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:NoReheat object creates the capability of supplying central system air directly to a zone without any zone level thermostat control. The supply air temperature is controlled by the central system controller. It is typically used with a unitary system and furnaces which controls the system supply temperature and flow rate with continuous or cycling fan. When used without the Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name, the terminal unit is passive and accepts any flow rate supplied by the central system, but will never exceed the maximum air flow rate.
This object allows the program to know what zone this branch of the air system is attached to, and input fields for availability schedule, air inlet and outlet nodes, the maximum air flow rate, and other two optional input fields. The air inlet node should be the same as one of the {{AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter}} or {{AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPlenum}} component  outlet nodes. The air outlet node name should be same as zone air inlet node name and the air distribution unit air outlet node name. The last two optional input fields: {Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name}, and {Per Person Ventilation Rate Mode} are used for modulating the outdoor air requirement of an air terminal unit depending on the method.
```

##  Field: Name

```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name

```
The air inlet node name that connects the air splitter to the individual zone air distribution unit. This node should also be one of the outlet air node of an {AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter} or {AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPlenum} component.
```

MaximumAirFlowRate
```
The design maximum volume flow rate~ (m^{3}/sec). This field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name 
DesignSpecificationOutdoorAirObjectName
```
This field is used to modulate the terminal unit flow rate based on the specified outdoor air requirement. When the name of a {DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir} or {DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir:SpaceList} object is entered, the terminal unit will adjust flow to meet this outdoor air requirement and no more. Load is still Uncontrolled. If Outdoor Air Flow per Person is non-zero, then the outdoor air requirement will be computed based on either the current or design occupancy as specified in the {Per Person Ventilation Rate Mode} input field below. At no time will the supply air flow rate exceed the value for Maximum Air Flow Rate. The requested flow rate may not be fully met if the system is operating with cycling fan. The volume flow rate is converted to mass flow rate using the standard density of air at Pressure = 101325 Pa, Temperature = 20C, and Humidity Ratio = 0.0. If this field is blank, then the terminal unit will not be controlled for outdoor air flow. This field is optional.
```
	
##  Field: Per Person Ventilation Rate Mode 
PerPersonVentilationRateMode
```
This field specifies the occupancy level to use when calculating the ventilation rate per person when a Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name has been specified. {CurrentOccupancy} uses the current number of people in the zone which may vary. {DesignOccupancy} uses the total Number of People specified for the zone which is constant.
```
	
# AirTerminalSingleDuctVAVReheat

`AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat`
```
AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat - Variable air volume (VAV) systems control the dry-bulb temperature inside a zone by varying the supply air volume instead of the air temperature. At full cooling the VAV damper is fully open supplying the specified maximum air flow rate. As the cooling load decreases, the damper closes until it reaches the minimum stop specified by the zone minimum air flow fraction. The zone minimum supply air flow can be further adjusted using scheduled fraction values specified in the field {Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name}.
VAV systems can be used for interior or perimeter zones with a common fan system, air temperature control, and reheating devices. The VAV concept may vary according to the VAV box locations, air temperature controls and types of heating elements. Heating can usually be provided by use of reheat coils or thermostatic baseboard.

```
	
##  Field: Maximum Air Flow Rate 
MaximumAirFlowRate
```
The design maximum volume flow rate (m^{3}/sec) specified for VAV ADU.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Minimum Air Flow Method 
ZoneMinimumAirFlowMethod
```
This field is used to select how the program will determine the minimum flow rate to the zone while the system is operating.~ The minimum flow rate is modeled as a fraction of the maximum flow rate.~ There are three choices for selecting how the minimum flow rate is specified:~ Constant, FixedFlowRate, and Scheduled.~ If Constant is entered, then the program will use the value for the constant minimum air flow fraction entered in the following field.~ If FixedFlowRate is entered, then the program will use the value for minimum flow rate entered in the field below called Fixed Minimum Air Flow Rate.~ If Scheduled is entered, then the program will obtain the value for minimum flow fraction from the schedule named in the field below called Minimum Air Flow Fraction Schedule Name.~ The default is Constant.
```
	
##  Field: Constant Minimum Air Flow Fraction 
ConstantMinimumAirFlowFraction
```
The minimum flow rate to the zone while the system is operating, specified as a fraction of the maximum air flow rate. The minimum zone fraction is normally specified to meet the minimum ventilation requirement for the occupants. The reheat coil operates only when the damper is at this minimum flow rate when Damper Heating Action is set to Normal.~ This field is used if the previous field is set to Constant.~ If the previous field is set to Scheduled (and the field Maximum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate is set to autosize), then this field is optional and can be used to separately control the air flow rate used for sizing normal-action reheat coils. If this field and the following field have values, the greater of the two is used for sizing.
This field is autosizable and defaulted to autosize. The autosized flow fraction is calculated using the maximum flow rate derived from the design outdoor air flow (including VRP adjustments) and the {Sizing:Zone} input fields ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow per Zone Floor Area'', ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow'', and ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow Fraction''. If there is no sizing calculation the defaults of 0.000762 cubic meters per second per square meter of zone floor area (0.15 cfm/ft2) and 0.2 are used. The autosized flow fraction is calculated according to the ASHRAE Standard 62.1 Simplified Procedure if the Sizing:System's ``System Outdoor Air Method'' associated with this terminal is set to Standard62.1SimplifiedProcedure, see the {System Outdoor Air Method} of the Sizing:System object.
```
	
##  Field: Fixed Minimum Air Flow Rate 
FixedMinimumAirFlowRate
```
The minimum flow rate to the zone while the system is operating, specified as a fixed minimum air flow rate in meters cubed per second. The minimum air flow rate is normally specified to meet the minimum ventilation requirement for the occupants. The reheat coil operates only when the damper is at this minimum flow rate when Damper Heating Action is set to Normal (the default).~ This field is used if the Zone Minimum Air Flow Method field is set to FixedFlowRate. If the Zone Minimum Air Flow Method field is set to Scheduled (and the field Maximum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate is set to autosize), then this field is optional and can be used to separately control the air flow rate used for sizing normal-action reheat coils. Only one of these two minimum air flow fields (i.e., this field and the previous field) should be used at any time. If this field and the previous field have values, the greater of the two is used for sizing.
This field is autosizable and defaulted to autosize. The autosized flow rate is the maximum flow rate derived from the design outdoor air flow (including VRP adjustments) and the {Sizing:Zone} input fields ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow per Zone Floor Area'', ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow'', and ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow Fraction''. If there is no sizing calculation the defaults of 0.000762 cubic meters per second per square meter of zone floor area (0.15 cfm/ft2) and 0.2 flow fraction are used. The autosized flow rate is calculated according to the ASHRAE Standard 62.1 Simplified Procedure if the Sizing:System's ``System Outdoor Air Method'' associated with this terminal is set to Standard62.1SimplifiedProcedure, see the {System Outdoor Air Method} of the Sizing:System object.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Air Flow Fraction Schedule Name 
MinimumAirFlowFractionScheduleName
```
The name of a schedule that determines the value of the minimum air flow fraction.~ The schedule should contain fractions from 0.0 to 1.0.~ These values will define the minimum flow rate to the zone while the system is operating, specified as a fraction of the maximum air flow rate.~ The reheat coil operates only when the damper is at this minimum flow rate when Damper Heating Action is set to Normal (the default).~ This field is used if the previous field is set to Scheduled.~ If the previous field is left blank (and the field Maximum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate is set to autosize), then the air flow rate used for sizing normal-action reheat coils is the average of the minimum and maximum values in this schedule.~ The air flow rate used for reheat coil sizing is reported with other component sizing information as ``Reheat Coil Sizing Air Volume Flow Rate.''
```
	
##  Field: Reheat Coil Object Type 
ReheatCoilObjectType
```
The valid reheat component objects currently available are:
  {Coil:Heating:Water}
  {Coil:Heating:Electric}
  {Coil:Heating:Fuel}
  {Coil:Heating:Steam}
If there is no reheat coil, use {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:NoReheat} instead of this object.
```
	
##  Field: Reheat Coil Name 
ReheatCoilName
```
Reheat Coil Object name being simulated with this ADU. Applicable for all coils. If there is no reheat coil, use object {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:NoReheat} instead of this object.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate 
MaximumHotWaterOrSteamFlowRate
```
This field is zero for gas and electric coils. Set to the maximum design hot water or steam volumetric flow rate in m^{3}/s for the hot water or steam heating coil. The steam volumetric flow rate is calculated at 100C and 101325 Pa. This field is autosizable. If there is no reheat coil, this is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate 
MinimumHotWaterOrSteamFlowRate
```
This field is zero for gas and electric coils. Set to the minimum design hot water or steam volumetric flow rate in m^{3}/s for the hot water or steam heating coil, normally set to be a shut off valve that is set to zero. The steam volumetric flow rate is calculated at 100C and 101325 Pa. If there is no reheat coil, this is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName
```
The terminal unit outlet node. This is the outlet node of the reheat coil and the zone inlet node.
```
	
##  Field: Convergence Tolerance 
ConvergenceTolerance
```
The coil is controlled by knowing the zone demand determined by the zone thermostat and setting the outlet conditions to meet this demand. For the electric and gas coils, this is set exactly since the coil model solution can be inverted. With the hot water coil that uses an effectiveness-NTU method, the solution cannot be inverted directly. Therefore, to determine the correct mass flow rate for the hot water the solution is solved for by iteration. The iterative solution uses an interval halving routine and needs a termination criteria that is set with the Convergence Tolerance parameter. This control offset is set to a decimal fraction of the zone demand as the criteria, i.e.~0.001. The default for the field is 0.001.
```
	
##  Field: Damper Heating Action 
DamperHeatingAction
```
During heating operation, there are three control options for the damper controlling the air flow in the VAV terminal unit as the zone moves above or below the zone setpoint. With all three control options, the damper is at the minimum air flow rate whenever the zone temperature is between the cooling and heating setpoints (deadband condition).
With {Normal} action, the damper will remain at the minimum air flow rate during heating operation. As the heating load increases, the water flow rate in the reheat coil will be increased to maintain temperature in the zone until the maximum water flow rate is reached or the user-specified maximum reheat air temperature is reached. This is sometimes called the single maximum control logic as illustrated below.
With {Reverse} and {ReverseWithLimits} (the default) action, as the heating load increases, the unit starts at minimum air flow and minimum hot water flow. The hot water flow is increased until it reaches maximum flow or the user-specified maximum reheat air temperature is reached, then the air damper starts to open to meet the load. For {Reverse} the damper can open all the way. For {ReverseWithLimits}s the damper can only partially open to a maximum flow rate given by the following two fields. These options are used if the minimum air flow rate is not adequate to serve the peak heating load. This is sometimes called the dual maximum control logic as illustrated in following figure. For heating coil types other than the hot-water coil, e.g.~electric, steam, and gas, the reverse action works the same as the normal action -- always keeping the air flow at the minimum during heating.
The dual-max control currently applies to the AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat objects with reverse acting dampers and hot-water coils.
```
	
##  Control Fields for Maximum Flow During Reheat: 
ControlsForMaximumFlowDuringReheat
```
The following two fields are used only when Reheat Coil Object Type = {Coil:Heating:Water} and Damper Heating Action = ReverseWithLimits. Maximum Flow per Zone Floor Area During Reheat and Maximum Flow Fraction During Reheat are two optional methods to calculate the maximum allowable air flow rate during reheat operation. If both are entered, the greater resulting flow rate is used. If Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name is also specified, it may increase this limit to meet the outdoor air flow rate requirement. At no time will the maximum flow rate calculated here exceed the value for Maximum Air Flow Rate.
This limit is active only when the zone thermostat requests heating and the VAV box damper is reverse acting (i.e., ReverseWithLimits).
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Flow per Zone Floor Area During Reheat 
MaximumFlowPerZoneFloorAreaDuringReheat
```
This factor (m^{3}/s-m^{2}) is multiplied by the zone area, to determine the maximum volume flow rate (m^{3}/s) allowed during reheat operation (see detailed explanation above). This field is autosizable and its default is autosize. If autosize is selected or the field is blank, the value is filled from the similar inputs in {Sizing:Zone}. If there is no sizing calculation the value is set to 0.002032 m^{3}/s-m^{2} (0.4 cfm/ft^{2}). If this field and the following field are entered, the greater of the two inputs is used. This field and the following field are only used if Damper Heating Action = ReverseWithLimits.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Flow Fraction During Reheat 
MaximumFlowFractionDuringReheat
```
This fraction is multiplied by the Maximum Air Flow Rate to determine the maximum volume flow rate (m^{3}/s) allowed during reheat operation (see detailed explanation above). This field is autosizeable and is defaulted to autosize. If autosizeable is selected or the field is blank, the value is set to 0.002032 m^{3}/s-m^{2} (0.4 cfm/ft^{2}) multiplied by the zone floor area divided by the Maximum Air Flow Rate. If this field and the previous field are entered, the greater of the two inputs is used. This field and the following field are only used if Damper Heating Action = ReverseWithLimits.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Reheat Air Temperature 
MaximumReheatAirTemperature
```
This field specifies a maximum supply air temperature (°C) leaving the reheat coil in a VAV terminal unit during heating operation. If leaving blank, the temperature of the supply air to the space in heating operation may get unrealistic high.
```
	
##  Field: Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name 
DesignSpecificationOutdoorAirObjectName
```
This alpha field specifies the name of a {DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir} or {DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir:SpaceList} object. When this field is used, the terminal unit will increase flow as needed to meet this outdoor air requirement. If Outdoor Air Flow per Person is non-zero, then the outdoor air requirement will be computed based on the current number of occupants in the zone. At no time will the supply air flow rate exceed the value for Maximum Air Flow Rate. If this field is blank, then the terminal unit will not be controlled for outdoor air flow. See documentation for the zone HVAC outdoor air object for further information (Ref {DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir}).
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name 
MinimumAirFlowTurndownScheduleName
```
This field adjusts the {Constant Minimum Air Flow Fraction}, {Fixed Minimum Air Flow Rate}, or {Minimum Air Flow Fraction Schedule} value by multiplying it using this schedule. Schedule values are fractions, 0.0 to 1.0. This field adjusts the minimum airflow turndown value below the zone design minimum air flow and is intended for use with ASHRAE Standard 170. This field can also be used to adjust the design minimum air flow sizing calculation by applying a desired fraction values to summer and winter design days turndown schedule. If this field is left blank, then the turndown minimum air flow fraction value is set to 1.

# AirTerminalSingleDuctVAVReheatVariableSpeedFan

`AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat:VariableSpeedFan`
```
The VAV terminal unit with variable-speed fan and reheat coil is an air system terminal unit consisting of a variable speed fan in series with a heating coil. These units are usually employed in underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems where the air is supplied at low static pressure through an underfloor plenum. The fan is used to control the flow of conditioned air that enters the space. When the fan is off the plenum pressure drives the minimum air flow through the terminal unit. At maximum cooling the fan runs at its maximum speed. At full heating the fan runs at its heating maximum -- usually less than the cooling maximum flow rate. Thus this unit has two separate maximum flow rates -- one for heating and one for cooling.
For cooling, control is maintained simply by varying the fan speed. For heating, the unit first tries to meet the heating load by varying the heating coil output while keeping the air flow at minimum (fan off). If this is not adequate the fan turns on and operates in variable flow mode up to the heating maximum flow rate. The zone fan-off minimum supply air flow can be further adjusted using scheduled fraction values specified in the field {Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name}.
This unit is modeled in EnergyPlus as a compound component -- a variable speed fan and a heating coil in series in the air stream. The unit is blow through -- the fan is upstream of the heating coil.

# AirTerminalSingleDuctVAVHeatAndCoolReheat

`AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:Reheat`
```
Variable air volume (VAV) systems typically control the dry-bulb temperature inside a zone by varying the supply air volume instead of the supply air temperature (ref: {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:NoReheat}). Reheat coils may be required to avoid overcooling (ref: {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat}).
This terminal unit is slightly different from the {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat} terminal unit. Both operate the same in cooling mode: the damper opens as needed to provide additional sensible cooling to the zone. The difference between the two is in heating mode.~ For the Single Duct VAV Reheat terminal unit, the air flow rate is reduced to the minimum value (max air flow rate x zone minimum air flow fraction) when zone heating is required and the reheat coil output is modulated to meet the zone heating load. The zone minimum supply air flow can be further adjusted using scheduled fraction values specified in the field {Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name}.~ For the AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:Reheat terminal unit, the air flow rate in heating mode is increased to meet higher zone heating loads (similar to what is done in cooling mode). If additional heat is required (beyond what the terminal unit can provide with its damper fully open), then the reheat coil is modulated as needed to meet the additional heating load.
This terminal unit model was originally developed and tested for use with the changeover-bypass VAV unitary system.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
Unique user-defined name for this Air Distribution Unit (ADU).
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether or not this component is available to operate during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the component can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the component must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Damper Air Outlet Node Name 
DamperAirOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the VAV damper air outlet node. This is the outlet node of the damper and the inlet node of the reheat coil.
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the air inlet node that connects the air splitter to the individual zone ADU. This is {not} the same as the air inlet node of the reheat component: it is upstream of that node. This is the inlet node to the terminal unit and the damper.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Air Flow Rate 
MaximumAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the design maximum volumetric flow rate (m^{3}/sec) specified for this VAV ADU. This flow rate must be greater than 0 or can be autosized.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Minimum Air Flow Fraction 
ZoneMinimumAirFlowFraction
```
This numeric field defines the minimum air volumetric flow rate to the zone while the system is operating, specified as a fraction of the maximum air flow rate. The minimum zone fraction is normally specified to meet the minimum ventilation requirement for the occupants. The reheat coil operates as needed to maintain the heating set point specified in the Zone Control:Thermostatic object. This value must be between 0 and 1.
```
	
##  Field: Reheat Coil Object Type 
ReheatCoilObjectType
```
The valid reheat component objects currently available are:
  {Coil:Heating:Water}
  {Coil:Heating:Electric}
  {Coil:Heating:Fuel}
  {Coil:Heating:Steam}
If no reheat coil is required, use {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:NoReheat} instead of this object.
```
	
##  Field: Reheat Coil Name 
ReheatCoilName
```
Unique coil name being simulated with this ADU. Applicable for all coils. If there is no reheat coil, use {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:NoReheat} instead of this object.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate 
MaximumHotWaterOrSteamFlowRate
```
This field is ignored for gas or electric reheat coils. If using a hot water or steam reheat coil, set to the maximum design water or steam volumetric flow rate in m^{3}/s for the hot water or steam heating coil. The steam volume flow rate is calculated at 100C and 101325 Pa. This volumetric flow rate can be autosized.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate 
MinimumHotWaterOrSteamFlowRate
```
This field is ignored for gas and electric coils. Set to the minimum design water or steam volumetric flow rate in m^{3}/s for the hot water or steam heating coil, normally set to be a shut-off valve that is set to zero. The steam volume flow rate is calculated at 100C and 101325 Pa.
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName
```
This is the air outlet node for the ADU and is then connected to the zone. This is the same node as the air outlet node of the reheat component.
```
	
##  Field: Convergence Tolerance 
ConvergenceTolerance
```
The coil is controlled by knowing the zone demand determined by the zone thermostat and setting the outlet conditions to meet this demand. For the electric and gas coils, this is set exactly since the coil model solution can be inverted and this field is not used. With the hot water coil that uses an effectiveness-NTU method, the solution cannot be inverted directly. Therefore, to determine the correct mass flow rate for the hot water the solution is solved by iteration. The iterative solution uses an interval-halving routine and needs a termination criterion that is set with this Convergence Tolerance parameter. This control offset is set to a decimal fraction of the zone demand. The default value for this field is 0.001.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Reheat Air Temperature 
MaximumReheatAirTemperature
```
This is the upper limit on the temperature in degrees C of the air leaving the terminal unit -- reheat coil (and being delivered to the zone). If the user leaves this field blank, no maximum reheat air temperature is enforced.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name 
MinimumAirFlowTurndownScheduleName
```
This field adjusts the {Zone Minimum Air Flow Fraction} by multiplying it using this schedule. Schedule values are fractions, 0.0 to 1.0. This field adjusts the minimum airflow turndown value below the zone design minimum air flow and is intended for use with ASHRAE Standard 170. This field can also be used to adjust the design minimum air flow sizing calculation by applying a desired fraction values to summer and winter design days turndown schedule. If this field is left blank, then the turndown minimum air flow fraction value is set to 1 and uses the fixed fraction specified in the field {Zone Minimum Air Flow Fraction}.

# AirTerminalSingleDuctVAVNoReheat

`AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:NoReheat`
```
Variable air volume (VAV) systems control the dry-bulb temperature inside a zone by varying the supply air volume instead of the air temperature. At full cooling the VAV damper is fully open supplying the specified maximum air flow rate. As the cooling load decreases, the damper closes until it reaches the minimum stop specified by the zone minimum air flow fraction. The zone minimum supply air flow can be adjusted using scheduled fraction values specified in the field {Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name}.
VAV systems can be used for interior or perimeter zones with a common fan system and air temperature control. The VAV concept may vary according to the VAV box locations and air temperature controls. Heating can be provided if necessary by use of baseboard.

This field is used to select how the program will determine the minimum flow rate to the zone while the system is operating.~ The minimum flow rate is modeled as a fraction of the maximum flow rate.~ There are three choices for selecting how the minimum flow rate is specified:~ Constant, FixedFlowRate, and Scheduled.~ If Constant is entered, then the program will use the value for the constant minimum air flow fraction entered in the following field.~ If FixedFlowRate is entered, then the program will use the value for minimum flow rate entered in the field below called Fixed Minimum Air Flow Rate.~ If Scheduled is entered, then the program will obtain the value for minimum flow fraction from the schedule named in the field below called Minimum Air Flow Fraction Schedule Name. The default is Constant.
```
	
##  Field: Constant Minimum Air Flow Fraction 
ConstantMinimumAirFlowFraction
```
The minimum flow rate to the zone while the system is operating, specified as a fraction of the maximum air flow rate. The minimum zone fraction is normally specified to meet the minimum ventilation requirement for the occupants. This field is only used if the Zone Minimum Air Flow Method field is set to Constant.
This field is autosizable and defaulted to autosize. If a Sizing:System {System Outdoor Air Method} other than Standard62.1SimplifiedProcedure is specified, the autosized flow fraction is calculated using the maximum flow rate derived from the design outdoor air flow (including VRP adjustments) and the {Sizing:Zone} input fields ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow per Zone Floor Area'', ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow'', and ``Cooling Minimum Air Flow Fraction''. If there is no sizing calculation the defaults of 0.000762 cubic meters per second per square meter of zone floor area (0.15 cfm/ft2) and 0.2 are used.

# AirTerminalSingleDuctSeriesPIUReheat

`AirTerminal:SingleDuct:SeriesPIU:Reheat`
```
The series powered induction unit is an air system terminal unit that mixes varying amounts of secondary (recirculated) air and primary (conditioned supply) air to produce a fixed flow of air to a zone. The unit contains a small fan that acts to induce the secondary air and a heating coil for heating the mixed secondary and primary air. The fan runs at a constant volume flow rate whenever the unit is on (and the fan's availability schedule is on or it is activated by an availability manager). The fan is downstream of the primary and secondary air inlets. The variable mixing is accomplished by a damper in the unit's primary air supply inlet duct. This damper can move from fully open (100% primary air. 0% secondary air) to a minimum stop that is specified in the input description. At full cooling the damper will be fully open. At minimum cooling and for heating the damper will be at the minimum stop and the secondary air flow will be at its maximum. During night cycle operation, if the availability manager status is CycleOnZoneFansOnly, then the fan will run only if there is a heating load.  If the status is CycleOn, then the fan will run according to the normal controls.
The EnergyPlus model of the series PIU terminal unit is composed of three components: a zone mixer, a constant volume fan, and a heating coil (hot water, electric, or gas).

# AirTerminalSingleDuctParallelPIUReheat

`AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ParallelPIU:Reheat`
```
The parallel powered induction unit is an air system terminal unit that mixes varying amounts of secondary (recirculated) air and primary (conditioned supply) air to produce a variable total flow of air to a zone. The unit contains a small fan that acts to induce the secondary air and a heating coil for heating the mixed secondary and primary air. The secondary and primary air streams enter the unit in parallel. The fan sits in the secondary air stream and runs only when the primary air flow is below the Fan On Flow Fraction and the fan's availability schedule is on or it is activated by an availability manager. The primary air inlet contains a damper that can move from fully open (maximum primary air) to a minimum stop (minimum primary air).
At full cooling load the primary air damper is fully open and the fan is off. The primary air flow is at maximum and there is little or no secondary air flow. As the cooling load decreases, the primary air damper gradually closes and the secondary air flow remains close to zero. At some point, usually when the primary air flow has reached the minimum, the fan switches on and secondary air is induced. The heating coil will switch on as needed to meet any heating demand. The Fan On Flow Fraction field controls the fan operation; see this field description for more details.
The EnergyPlus model of the parallel PIU terminal unit is composed of three components: a constant volume fan, a zone mixer, and a heating coil (hot water, electric, or gas).

# AirTerminalSingleDuctConstantVolumeFourPipeInduction

`AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:FourPipeInduction`
```
The four pipe induction terminal unit provides local hot water heating or chilled water cooling of induced zone air which then mixes with centrally conditioned supply air. An air conditioning system consisting of these terminal units is effectively a mixed central air / local hydronic system. The centrally conditioned air supplied to the induction terminal units is constant volume at quite high pressure. The central air is discharged through a nozzle in the terminal unit, inducing a flow of room air over a hydronic heating/cooling coil. The coil is connected either to a single inlet and outlet pipe (2 pipe unit) or to 2 inlets and 2 outlets (4 pipe unit). The heated or cooled induced air mixes with the centrally conditioned air before being discharged into the zone. The terminal units are usually expected to do only sensible cooling -- any dehumidification is done by the central air conditioning system.
The EnergyPlus model of the four pipe induction terminal unit is a compound component consisting of a hot water heating coil, a chilled water cooling coil, and an air mixer. The unit has two inlet air streams: the centrally conditioned supply air and the induced air from the zone. The induced air passes first through the heating coil, then through the cooling coil and finally through the mixer. The central supply air goes directly into the mixer. The water flow through the hot or cold water coil is varied to meet the zone air conditioning requirement. Note that EnergyPlus models the four pipe induction terminal unit as having separate heating and cooling coils whereas real units have only a single coil used for both heating and cooling. Note also that the four pipe induction unit model can be used to model a two pipe unit by simply adjusting the heating and cooling coil schedules so that the heating coil is off when the cooling coil is on and vice versa.

# AirTerminalSingleDuctConstantVolumeFourPipeBeam

`AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:FourPipeBeam`
```
The four-pipe beam air terminal system is a mixed air-hydronic system. A central, single-duct forced-air system that supplies conditioned air to the zones. Chilled water circulates through ceiling-mounted fin-tube convector units to provide sensible cooling. Hot water circulates through the same convectors to provide heating. Water flow rate through the beam unit is varied to meet the zone sensible cooling or heating load. Any dehumidification is done by the central forced-air system. Thermodynamically, the cooled beam system resembles the four-pipe induction unit ({{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:FourPipeInduction}}).
To model a typical four-pipe beam system the user will need to define a conventional central constant volume forced air system in order to deliver primary air to the beam. This central system (usually) provides outside air for ventilation. Primary air is normally delivered at a fixed temperature but could be reset by a schedule or using an outdoor air reset setpoint manager. On the supply side of this air loop there will be the usual central conditioning equipment: outside air mixer, fan, heating and cooling coil. On the zone equipment (demand) side of the loop, the four-pipe beams will be represented as air terminal units. Because the four-pipe beam can provide heating the system can avoid over-cooling zones during times of low load with cool primary air temperatures, similar to the action of a reheat coil in a VAV terminal. Therefore, it is not necessary to have additional zone equipment (such as baseboard heaters) to handle heating (or reheating) loads.
Although the four-pipe beam equipment in a zone is treated by the program as a single terminal unit, the actual installation will often have multiple beam units in each zone. In this model, it is only the total length of all the beams and the total air flow of all the units that are described, not the number of individual beam units.
If needed, the program (in its sizing calculation for the system) determines the total length of beams and primary supply air flow that is needed to meet the zone design loads. The four pipe beam air terminal sizing differs from other air terminals in that the primary supply air flow rate is sized using the entire performance model and the flow rate is not the direct result from the {Sizing:Zone} and {Sizing:System} calculations. The flow rates will be somewhere between what an air terminal would size out using {VentilationRequirement} or {Sensible} in the {Sizing:System} object (either setting can be used).
The model includes two different types of inputs for flow rates, ``design'' and ``rated \ldots{} per-meter.'' The design values are the actual sizes of the flow rates as viewed from the zone and central air handler (but before zone multipliers). The design values include all the individual beam units and their lengths. The rated per-meter values are used to characterize product performance at nominal rating conditions in such a way that it can be scaled to match the size of a zone. The performance characteristics at the rating point are not fixed in the program and can be entered by the user when they differ from default values. The rated per meter values are normalized by the linear dimensions of the beam and are generally obtained from product catalog data by dividing by the length of the beam. The rated primary air flow rate is assumed to be for sea level conditions while the design primary air flow rate is modeled for the location elevation above sea level.

# AirTerminalSingleDuctConstantVolumeCooledBeam

`AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:CooledBeam`
```
The Cooled Beam system is a mixed air-hydronic system. A central, single-duct forced-air system supplies conditioned ventilation air to the zones. Sensible cooling is done by chilled water circulating through ceiling mounted cooled beam units. Chilled water flow rate through the cooled beam units is varied to meet the zone sensible cooling load. Any dehumidification is done by the central ventilation air system. Heating is usually accomplished with hot water radiators. Thermodynamically, the cooled beam system resembles the four-pipe induction unit.
To model a typical cooled beam system the user will need to define a conventional central constant volume forced air system. This system will normally be 100% outside air delivered at a fixed supply temperature (which could be reset by schedule or by outside air temperature). On the supply side of this air loop there will be the usual central AC equipment: outside air mixer, fan, heating and cooling coil. On the zone equipment (demand) side of the loop, the chilled beams will be represented as terminal units. Additional zone equipment (such as baseboard heaters) will be needed to handle heating loads.
Although the cooled beam equipment in a zone is treated by the program as a single terminal unit, the actual installation will have multiple beams in each zone. The program (in its sizing calculation for the system) figures out how many beams of what length are needed to meet the zone design load.

The air terminal mixer provides a means of supplying central system air either to air inlet or supply side of a ZoneHVAC equipment such as a four pipe fan coil. Normally the central air would be ventilation air from a dedicated outside air system (DOAS).
This terminal mixer object mixes conditioned outdoor air (primary air) from DOAS air loop and recirculating (secondary air) and deliver it either to inlet or supply side of a local ZoneHVAC equipment. The terminal mixer can be connected either to the inlet or supply side of the local ZoneHVAC equipment and the connection type is specified in the input field {Mixer Connection Type}. If the AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer object is connected to the supply side, a mix of conditioned outdoor air from a central dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) with conditioned recirculation air from the local ZoneHVAC equipment is supplied as a single stream to the conditioned zone at its inlet node. If the AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer object is connected to the inlet side, a mix of outdoor air from the a central dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) with un-conditioned recirculation air from a zone exhaust node is supplied to the ZoneHVAC equipment inlet node. The mixer model will sum the two air streams and average the air properties. The AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer is used with:
 {ZoneHVAC:FourPipeFanCoil}
 {ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump}
 {ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalAirConditioner}
 {ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump}
 {ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow}
 {ZoneHVAC:UnitVentilator}
 {AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem}
The {AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem} object must be specified as a ZoneHVAC equipment. Since the ZoneHVAC equipment gets the outdoor air or ventilation air from central dedicated OA system, the design outdoor air flow rate input fields in the ZoneHVAC equipment are set to zero and the {OutdoorAir:Mixer} object type and object name input fields are left blank.

##  Field: Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name 
DesignSpecificationOutdoorAirObjectName
```
This field allows modifying the behavior of this air terminal so that it is modulated to supply the required outdoor air to the zone.  This field is optional. When the name of an {DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir} or {DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir:SpaceList} object is entered, the model is changed to adjust the flow rate to provide the volume of outdoor air described by that object.  This feature allows modeling demand controlled ventilation on a zone-by-zone basis using the Outdoor Air Flow per Person rate (specified in the {DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir} object) and the number of occupants (specified in the {People} object schedules).  If the outdoor air fraction of the supply air is 1.0, as for a dedicated outdoor air system, the air flow rate will match the outdoor air requirement.  When the outdoor air fraction is less than 1.0, as for a recirculating air system, the terminal air flow will be modulated upward to account for the increased total air flow needed to provide the required flow rate of outdoor air.   The total air flow rate will not exceed the Maximum Air Flow Rate specified above. The volume flow rate is converted to mass flow rate using the standard density of air at Pressure = 101325 Pa, Temperature = 20C, and Humidity Ratio = 0.0.

# AirTerminalDualDuctConstantVolume

`AirTerminal:DualDuct:ConstantVolume`
```
The AirTerminal:DualDuct:ConstantVolume simulation or the typical Multizone is described by this Air Distribution Unit (ADU). Multizone systems condition all the air in a central apparatus and distribute it to the conditioned zones through two parallel ducts. One duct carries cold air and the other warm air, providing air sources for both heating and cooling at all times. In each conditioned zone, a mixing valve responsive to a room thermostat mixes the warm and cold air in proper proportions to satisfy the prevailing heating or cooling load of the space. The Multizone ADU is the specific component that leads to the zone containing the mixer and the mixing damper and then connecting to the zone. The total airflow to each room is kept constant while the proportion of hot air to cold air is adjusted to maintain the temperature in each zone at the desired level.

# AirTerminalDualDuctVAV

`AirTerminal:DualDuct:VAV`
```
AirTerminal:DualDuct:VAV (i.e., Dual duct variable air volume (DDVAV)) systems are used to obtain zone temperature control by mixing the cold and warm air in various volume combinations. The fan is sized for the anticipated maximum coincident hot or cold volume, not the sum of the instantaneous peaks. This system has an advantage of a true single path VAV system, except for warm port leakage. When cold air is modulated for control before mixing, it operates similar to the VAV induction when mixing occurs without hot deck reheat. It is similar to a reheat system when mixing occurs while the hot deck is using the reheat coil. It uses more energy than a true VAV system, but less than a constant volume dual duct system.
The zone minimum supply air flow can be further adjusted using scheduled fraction values specified in the field {Minimum Air Flow Turndown Schedule Name}.

# AirTerminalDualDuctVAVOutdoorAir

`AirTerminal:DualDuct:VAV:OutdoorAir`
```
AirTerminal:DualDuct:VAV:OutdoorAir provides a model for a type of dual duct air system in which one duct provides outdoor air ventilation and the other provides VAV cooling.~ The Outdoor Air stream and the Recirculated Air stream are conditioned and supplied through separate air streams as part of a centralized dedicated outdoor air~ (DOAS) distribution system. The dual duct arrangement allows the ventilation air to be controlled separately using schedules or occupancy demand while the recirculated air is controlled to meet the dry-bulb zone temperature setpoint. The two airstreams remain decoupled until the terminal box where they are mixed. The terminal unit is meant for systems regulating outdoor air based only on demand control or code minimum settings and not on economizer operation.
This air terminal does not have heating coils and is not configured for conditions zones that need heat. Additional ZoneHVAC equipment, such as baseboards or fan coil units, are needed to provide heating to the zone when using this air terminal.
Although this air terminal is primarily for dual duct system, it is allowed to use just the outdoor air side in a single duct system. This can be useful for modeling single duct DOAS when the required volume of outdoor air varies over time.

# AirLoopHVAC

`AirLoopHVAC`
```
Air loops along with zone equipment form the entire forced air heating and cooling system (air side). The main statement for defining an air loop is the {AirLoopHVAC} object described here. As with the main plant and condenser statements, several of the items in the AirLoopHVAC object definition are actually names that refer to other objects in the input file. After the AirLoopHVAC object name, four such list pointers are encountered: for controllers, system availability, branches, and connectors. The Controller List defines how the air loop will respond due to various inputs (control signals). The Availability Manager List refers to methods for controlling when a system is operational. This may be as simple as a schedule to define when the system is shutdown. The Branch List lists the branches that comprise the primary air system. Finally, the Connector List lists the connections between the branches. The branches and connections together define the primary air system topology.
The only numeric input is the design primary air flow rate. This item is input just before the {BranchList} name.
The next series of names refer to nodes for the various inlet and outlet points of the air loop. The air loop starts where the zone equipment ends. This is a single point consisting of the return air duct once all of the zone return air streams have been collected (if the loop has a return path). While in reality, there is really only one point, for clarity within the simulation components and consistency with the other HVAC loop sections, this point in the systems is defined as two points: one that resides with the zone equipment simulation and one that is acted upon by the air loop simulation. Both node names must be entered into the input file (if the loop has a return path), and both nodes must have unique names. Similarly, the end points of the air loop that also correspond to the beginning points of the zone equipment loop must also be defined. These consist of names referencing lists of up to three pairs of node names as shown below. Up to three air loop outlets are allowed to accommodate the simulation of three duct systems.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This field is a unique, user assigned name for a single instance of an AirLoopHVAC object. Any other object referencing this AirLoopHVAC will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Controller List Name 
ControllerListName
```
This field is the name of a ControllerList object. A Controller List is simply a list of controllers giving both controller name and type. This Controller List specifies all the controllers that will act on this primary air loop. The order of the controllers in the list is significant: controllers are simulated sequentially in the order given in the Controller List.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Manager List Name 
AvailabilityManagerListName
```
This field is the name of a AvailabilityManagerList object. An Availability Manager List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this primary air loop. That is, they determine when and if this air loop is on or off, overriding the control provided by the central fan on/off schedule.
```

```
	
##  Field: Connector List Name 
ConnectorListName
```
This field is the name of {ConnectorList} object. This {ConnectorList} object lists all the Connectors (by type and name) that are included in this primary air system. These Connectors, together with the Branches in the {BranchList}, define the topology of the primary air system.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Side Inlet Node Name 
SupplySideInletNodeName
```
The name of the air entrance node of this primary air system. If this air loop has a return path, then this is the inlet node for return air for this air system. If this air loop does not have a return path, then this node is where outdoor air or other air enters the supply side.
```
	
##  Field: Demand Side Outlet Node Name 
DemandSideOutletNodeName
```
The name of the air outlet node for the zone equipment group ({ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections} objects) attached to the primary air system. This should be the outlet node of a {AirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixer} or AirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenum in the {AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath} for the zone equipment group attached to this primary air system. Leave this field blank if this air loop does not have a return path.
```
	
##  Field: Demand Side Inlet Node Names 
DemandSideInletNodeNames
```
This field can be the name of a node which is the air inlet node for the zone equipment group (see {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections} objects) attached to this primary air system. Or, this field can be the name of a node list containing one or more nodes (up to 3). These nodes should be the inlet nodes to the {AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter} or {AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPlenum} in each of the {AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPath}s for the zone equipment groups attached to this primary air system. For single duct systems, there is only one node name in this list. For two and three duct systems, the order of the nodes in this list must correspond with the order of the nodes in the Supply Side Outlet Node Names list.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Side Outlet Node Names 
SupplySideOutletNodeNames
```
This field can be the name of a node which is the air outlet node for each supply duct of this primary air system. Or, this field can be the name of a node list containing one or more nodes (up to 3). The list can contain the names of up to three nodes. For single duct systems, there is only one node name in this list. For two and three duct systems, the order of the nodes in this list must correspond with the order of the nodes in the Demand Side Inlet Node Names list.
```
	
##  Field: Design Return Air Flow Fraction of Supply Air Flow 
DesignReturnAirFlowFractionOfSupplyAirFlow
```
This field specifies the design air loop return air flow rate as a fraction of the supply flow rate when there is no exhaust flow.  It may be used to set zero return air flow for a DOAS system or to model a pressurized system where the return flow is a fraction of the supply flow. The return air flow rate will never be greater than the current supply air flow rate multiplied by this fraction.  It may be less if there is unbalanced exhaust from any zones served by this airloop. The default is 1.0. If the air loop has no return path, then this field is ignored.

# SystemsLevelReporting

`Systems Level Reporting`
```
Most output variables are a single entity reporting. Meters are a combination of like variables -- specifically for Energy Consumption. This section introduces a slightly different concept -- where output variables described herein are a combination of several similar items -- specifically targeted at HVAC/System level reporting. This reporting is coupled with an Air Loop (ref: {AirLoopHVAC})
All items shown in this section are typical ``output variables'' and can be reported with the {Output:Variable} object.
Or, as is shown by example here, perhaps a more readable form is to generate them in Tabular Form with the ``{Output:Table:Monthly}'' object.
```

# SystemLoadsOutputs

`System Loads Outputs`
```
In this category, the total system load is reported. Two aspects are reported here: Heating and Cooling. The following two variables report the heat energy that system components (including packaged equipment, fans, main coils, reheat coils, humidifiers, desiccant dehumidifiers, evaporative coolers and heat exchangers) add or remove from the air loop. Each variable within these grouping wil
```

# SystemEnergyUseOutputs

`System Energy Use Outputs`
```
System Energy Use consists of six output variables that report the total energy (in Joules) and water consumption (in m^{3}) for all system components and including packaged equipment, fans, main coils, reheat coils, humidifiers, desiccant dehumidifiers, and evaporative coolers. The output variables shown below show hot and cold water, steam, electric and gas energy. Hot and cold water energy includes all `district cooling' and `district heating' energy.
```

# SystemComponentLoadsOutputs

`System Component Loads Outputs`
```
Reporting System Component Loads shows the energy transferred to or extracted from the air loop by system component type. Fans, Cooling Coils, Heating Coils, Heat exchangers, humidifiers, evaporative coolers, and desiccant dehumidifiers show heat transfer rates in Joules. The components may be located in outdoor air systems bundled with packaged equipment or specified as stand-alone components. The reporting accounts for both main branch and reheat coils.
The Standard reports file includes these variables reporting in the Tabular report form as ``Air Loop System Component Loads''.

# OverallAirLoopSyntax

`Overall Air Loop Syntax`
```
A map for Air Loop input syntax is shown in the following diagram.
```

# AirLoopHVACControllerList

`AirLoopHVAC:ControllerList`
```
The syntax for the AirLoopHVAC:ControllerList definition is shown below. As with other lists in EnergyPlus input, the object title and identifying name are followed by type-name pairs. In this case, the types are controller types. The order in which controllers appear on this list also define the priority as described below. The identifying name refers back to the name recorded in the {AirLoopHVAC} statement.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
The user designated unique name of an instance of a Controller List. Any object referencing this Controller List will do so using this name.
```
	
##  Field Set (Object Type, Controller Name) up to 8 
SetObjectTypeControllerNameUpTo8
```
After the identifying name, input for the controller list consists of up to 8 pairs of data items: a controller type and a controller name. The first controller listed has the highest priority, the second the second highest priority, and so forth.
```
	
##  Field: Controller <x> Object Type 
ControllerXObjectType
```
The type of~ controller. This should be a key word defining a class of controllers such as {Controller:WaterCoil}.
```
	
##  Field: Controller <x> Name 
ControllerXName
```
The name of a controller object (such as a {Controller:WaterCoil}) defined elsewhere in the input file.
An example of this statement in an IDF is:
AirLoopHVAC:ControllerList,
             Dual Duct System 1 Controllers,
             Controller:WaterCoil, Main Cooling Coil Controller,
             Controller:WaterCoil, Main Heating Coil Controller;
```
	
# AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList

`AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList`
```
The AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList defines the applicable managers used for an {AirLoopHVAC} or {PlantLoop}. The priority of availability managers is based on a set of rules and are specific to the type of loop. The output from each Availability Manager is an availability status flag. This flag can have the values {NoAction}, {ForceOff}, {CycleOn}, or {CycleOnZoneFansOnly} (used only for air loops). The availability status flags for the Availability Managers referenced by an air or plant loop are used to set the availability status flag for each loop. For the air loops, {ForceOff} takes precedence: if any of the loop's availability managers are showing status {ForceOff}, the loop status will be {ForceOff}. Next in precedence is {CycleOnZoneFansOnly,} followed by {CycleOn}, and {NoAction}. For the plant loops, there is no precedence among the Availability Manager status flag values. Instead, the first availability manager giving a status flag value other than {NoAction} sets the status for the loop. The Availability Managers are executed in Availability Manager List order.
Special rules also apply for which managers may be listed in an Availability Manager list. The Hybrid Ventilation Control Manager (object: {AvailabilityManager:HybridVentilation}) is a special type of manager and is never specified in an Availability Manager List (it is used stand-alone for a specific air loop). All other types of availability managers may be listed in the Availability Manager List used for {AirLoopHVAC}s. For Plant Loops, the Night Cycle and Night Ventilation managers (objects: {AvailabilityManager:NightCycle} ~and {AvailabilityManager:NightVentilation}) are not allowed in the Availability Manager List.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
The name of the AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList ~object. This is referenced by {AirLoopHVAC} and {PlantLoop} objects.
```
	
##  Field Set (Availability Manager Object Type, Name) 
SetAvailabilityManagerObjectTypeName
```
Managers are listed by pairs of data items:~ {Availability Manager Object Type} and {Availability Manager Name}. The managers are simulated down the list and calculate a control status for use by the {AirLoopHVAC} or {PlantLoop}. The priority of each manager used for a specific loop is based on the rules described above. Availability managers are not currently used for condenser loops. The availability managers, along with the {AirLoopHVAC} and {PlantLoop} object, report the control status calculated each simulation timestep. These output variables can be used to prioritize the managers according to the required control strategy. Six managers are accomodated in the list by default.  This object is extensible, so additional pairs of the next two fields may be added.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Manager <x> Object Type 
AvailabilityManagerXObjectType
```
The key word defining the type of manager, e.g.~{AvailabilityManager:NightCycle}.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Manager<x>~ Name

# AirLoopHVACOutdoorAirSystem

`AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem`
```
The Outside Air System (object AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem) is a subsystem of an {AirLoopHVAC}. It handles the mixed air portion of the primary air system: the system relief air, the outside air inlet, and any components and controllers associated with the system relief air and outside air streams. From the perspective of the primary air loop the Outside Air System is treated as a single component. As a subsystem, it can contain one or more components and controllers.
The input for the Outside Air System consists of a system name, a controller list name, and an equipment list name. The controller list simply lists, by type and unique name, all the controllers in the subsystem. The controllers will be simulated in list order. The equipment list lists all the components in the subsystem, by type and name. The equipment is simulated in list order.
The equipment inlet/outlet must be sequential with no loops - the simulation can only handle a straight-through air path, both on the primary air side and on the secondary air side, if any. Heat exchanger secondary air inlets need to be independent of the primary air stream -- usually relief air is used.
The Outside Air System (object AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem) can also be defined as a subsystem of an {AirLoopHVAC:DedicatedOutdoorAirSystem}. When this subsystem is referred in AirLoopHVAC:DedicatedOutdoorAirSystem, the {Controller:OutdoorAir} can not be listed in the {AirLoopHVAC:ControllerList}, because the outdoor air flow rate will not be determined by Controller:OutdoorAir. Instead, the outdoor air flow rate will be specified by {AirLoopHVAC:DedicatedOutdoorAirSystem}.  In addition, the {OutdoorAir:Mixer} will not be allowed in the {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList} as a component, because no mix is needed due to 100% outdoor incoming airflow determined by AirLoopHVAC:DedicatedOutdoorAirSystem.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
The unique, user assigned name for a single instance of an Outside Air System. Any other object referencing this Outside Air System will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Name: Controller List Name 
NameControllerListName
```
This field is the name of a {AirLoopHVAC:ControllerList} object. A {AirLoopHVAC:ControllerList} is simply a list of controllers giving both controller name and type. This Controller List specifies all the controllers that will act on this outside air system. The order of the controllers in the list is significant: controllers are simulated sequentially in the order given in the Controller List. Typically the Controller List would contain a {Controller:OutdoorAir}. If there are chilled water or hot water coils in the outdoor air system, each such coil will need a {Controller:WaterCoil}.
When this object is referred in {AirLoopHVAC:DedicatedOutdoorAirSystem}, the {Controller:OutdoorAir} will not be allowed in the list, becauseAirLoopHVAC:DedicatedOutdoorAirSystem does not need Controller:OutdoorAir to determine the amount of outdoor air flow rate.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Equipment List Name 
OutdoorAirEquipmentListName
```
This field is the name of an {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList} object. An {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList} is simply a list of components giving both component name and type. This Outdoor Air Equipment List specifies all the components that will be simulated in this outside air system. The order of the components in the list is significant: components are simulated sequentially in the order given in the Outdoor Air Equipment List. Typically the equipment list would contain at least an {OutdoorAir:Mixer}. If there is more than one component, the components must be listed in order from the outside air to the {OutdoorAir:Mixer} (the {OutdoorAir:Mixer} is last).
When this object is referred in {AirLoopHVAC:DedicatedOutdoorAirSystem}, the {OutdoorAir:Mixer} will not be allowed as a component, because all the incoming airflow is from outdoor, and no mixing is needed.

# OutdoorAirNode

`OutdoorAir:Node`
```
The OutdoorAir:Node object declares an HVAC system node for outdoor air conditions. The program automatically sets the air conditions at these nodes to correspond to the ambient environmental conditions at the beginning of every timestep. The outdoor air node is typically used as the inlet air node to an HVAC component such as the {OutdoorAir:Mixer} object. Multiple OutdoorAir:Node objects can be used in an input file, however, duplicate node names are not allowed.
The {Height Above Ground} field is used to adjust the weather file air conditions, e.g., outdoor dry-bulb and wet-bulb air temperatures, for atmospheric variation with height. This variation can become a significant factor when modeling tall buildings. See the Engineering Reference section on Atmospheric Variation for a description of the algorithm for variation of atmospheric properties with height. A blank entry or a value less than zero for this field indicates that the height will be ignored and the weather file conditions will be used.
{OutdoorAir:Node} and {{OutdoorAir:{NodeList}}} both set a node to outdoor air conditions. {OutdoorAir:Node} modifies the weather file conditions if a height has been specified. {{OutdoorAir:{NodeList}}} does not have a height input and always uses the weather file conditions without modification. The same node name may not be used with both of these objects.
When declared in surface property objects {{SurfaceProperty:LocalEnvironment}}, in zone property objects {{ZoneProperty:LocalEnvironment}}, or as an external node in the airflow network calculation linking to a surface node {AirflowNetwork:Multizone:Surface}, the object can also be used to define local outdoor air conditions for surfaces, zones or air loop components. The local outdoor air conditions would be used in the EnergyPlus calculations for:
 Convection coefficients used in the exterior surface heat balance
If the user declares a local surface outdoor air node to overwrite the surface level environmental data, the convection coefficients would be calculated based on the local outdoor air node data accordingly based on surface level outdoor dry-bulb temperature, humidity ratio and wind speed.
 Zone air infiltration and simple ventilation
If the user declares a local zone outdoor air node to overwrite zone level environmental data, global environmental variables used in the subroutines for infiltration and ventilation calculation, including outdoor air temperature, humidity ratio, enthalpy, wind speed and direction, would be overwritten accordingly with zone level data.
 External air nodes used in the AirFlowNetwork
When used in the airflow network for wind pressure calculation, global environmental variables used in the subroutines for wind pressure calculation, including outdoor air temperature, humidity ratio, air density, wind speed and direction, would be overwritten accordingly with local data.
When used in these cases, optional schedule inputs of local ambient air conditions, including dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature, wind velocity, and wind direction, can be defined in the optional fields. When used in the airflow network for wind pressure calculation, the wind pressure coefficient curve name and calculation details should also be defined.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
The unique name for this outdoor air node.
```
	
##  Field: Height Above Ground 
HeightAboveGround
```
The height [m] of the node above ground level. A value greater than zero allows the weather file conditions, e.g., outdoor dry-bulb and wet-bulb air temperatures, to be adjusted according to atmospheric variation with height.
A blank entry or value less than zero indicates that the height will be ignored and the weather file conditions will be used.
```
	
##  Field: Drybulb Temperature Schedule Name 
DrybulbTemperatureScheduleName
```
This field is used to supply a schedule name of the local dry bulb temperature of this node. When the field is left blank, global values would be used in calculation.

```
This field is used to supply a schedule name of the local wind speed of this node. When the field is left blank, global values would be used in calculation.
```
	
##  Field: Wind Direction Schedule Name 
WindDirectionScheduleName
```
This field is used to supply a schedule name of the local wind direction of this node. When the field is left blank, global values would be used in calculation.
```
	
##  Field: Wind Pressure Coefficient Curve Name 
WindPressureCoefficientCurveName
```
The name of a specific {{AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:WindPressureCoefficientValues}} object (which gives wind pressure coefficients for the fa??ade as a function of angle of wind incident on the fa??ade).
```
	
##  Field: Symmetric Wind Pressure Coefficient Curve 
SymmetricWindPressureCoefficientCurve
```
This field is used to specify whether the pressure curve is symmetric or not. {Yes} for curves that should be evaluated from 0 to 180 degrees. {No} for curves that should be evaluated from 0 to 360 degrees.
```
	
##  Field: Wind Angle Type 
WindAngleType
```
This field is used to specify whether the angle used to compute the wind pressure coefficient is absolute or relative. {Relative} for computing the angle between the wind direction and the surface azimuth. {Absolute} for using the wind direction angle directly.

# OutdoorAirNodeList

`OutdoorAir:NodeList`
```
The program needs to know which HVAC system nodes are inlets for outdoor air. Knowing this, the program can set the conditions at these nodes to the outdoor conditions at the start of each major timestep. The {OutdoorAir:Node}List provides the means for specifying which nodes are outdoor air nodes.
The input is flexible: there may be one or more {OutdoorAir:Node}List in each input file. Each list contains up to 25 names. The names can be the name of a unique HVAC system node, or the name of a Node List which will contain the actual node names. Duplicate node names are ignored.
{{OutdoorAir:Node}} and {{OutdoorAir:Node}List} both set a node to outdoor air conditions. {{OutdoorAir:Node}} modifies the weather file conditions if a height has been specified. {{OutdoorAir:Node}List} does not have a height input and always uses the weather file conditions without modification. The same node name may not be used with both of these objects.
```

##  Field: Node or NodeList name 
NodeOrNodeListName
```
The name of an HVAC system node or of a {NodeList} object. There can be up to 25 names.

# OutdoorAirMixer

`OutdoorAir:Mixer`
```
The OutdoorAir:Mixer is the most common component used in an outdoor air system. The outdoor air mixer has 2 inlet air streams: the system return air and the outdoor air. It has 2 outlet air streams: the system relief air and the mixed air. This is a passive component. It takes the inlet mass flows and conditions plus the relief air mass flow and calculates the mixed air flow rate and conditions (as well as the relief air conditions). The inlet and relief mass flow must be set outside the component -- most commonly by an outdoor air controller. The OutdoorAir:Mixer can also be used in compound components such as a fan coil unit.
Input for this object is very simple: a unique name plus the node names of the 2 inlet nodes and the 2 outlet nodes.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
A unique user assigned name for a particular outdoor air mixer component. Any reference to this component by another object will use this name.

# CoilCoolingDX

`Coil:Cooling:DX`
```
This coil input structure is meant to supplant the coil objects from previous EnergyPlus versions (Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed, Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed, Coil:Cooling:DX:MultiSpeed, etc.). This coil input structure uses a combination of four objects to fully define the performance of the coil under a range of operating conditions.
 Coil:Cooling:DX - Defines where the coil's evaporator and condenser sections are connected to the HVAC system through node connections to air loops or zones (if condenser section rejects heat to a zone), as well as the coil's availability.
 Coil:Cooling:DX:CurveFit:Performance - Defines how the coil operates over a range of operating conditions.
 Coil:Cooling:DX:CurveFit:OperatingMode - Defines the rated coil characteristics (capacity, evaporator section air flow rate, etc.) and capacity control method for a given operating mode. Operating modes are generally used to describe humidity control strategies for DX cooling coil arrangements that enable enhanced dehumidification.
 Coil:Cooling:DX:CurveFit:Speed - Defines DX cooling coil performance for a specific speed within a single operating mode.
Note: The Coil:Cooling:DX:CurveFit:Performance object also allows users to input 3 operating modes: Base Operating Mode, Alternative Operating Mode 1, and Alternative Operating Mode 2. When the Base Operating Mode is an only mode input, the coil performs like a regular cooling DX coil and no specific dehumidication capability. The alternative operating mode 1 is used for enhanced dehumidification. When all 3 modes are inputs, the coil performs as a subcool rehat coil. When load sensible heat ratio (SHR), defined as sensible cooling load / (sensible cooling load + latent cooling load), is greater than the SHR in the Base Operating Mode at given inlet air conditions, the coil performs in Base Operating Mode only. When the load SHR is less than the SHR in the Base Operating Mode and greater than the SHR in the Alternative Operating Mode 1 at the same given inlet air conditions, the coil performs combination of both Base Operating Mode, and Alternative Operating Mode 1. Mode ratio determines a fraction of time Alternative Operating Mode 1 operates and the rest (1 - Mode ratio) of time Base Operating Mode operates in a single time step. When the load SHR is less than the SHR in the Alternative Operating Mode 1 and greater than the SHR in the Alternative Operating Mode 2 at the same given inlet air conditions, the coil performs combination of both Base Operating Mode, and Alternative Operating Mode 2. Mode ratio determines a fraction of time Alternative Operating Mode 2 operates and (1 - Mode ratio) of time Base Operating Mode operates in a single time step.  When the load SHR is greater than the SHR in the Alternative Operating Mode 2, the coil performs as Alternative Operating Mode 2 alone.   
Figure{fig:diagram-of-coil-object-references} below represents the hierarchy how these four input objects reference each other. Arrows pointing from one object to another represents where one object has an input field that references the name of a different object. For example, an input field of the Coil:Cooling:DX object references the name of a Coil:Cooling:DX:CurveFit:Performance object. For this coil input structure, one Coil:Cooling:DX object can only reference one Coil:Cooling:DX:CurveFit:Performance object. However, one Coil:Cooling:DX:CurveFit:Performance object can reference multiple Coil:Cooling:DX:CurveFit:OperatingMode objects, and each Coil:Cooling:DX:CurveFit:OperatingMode object can reference multiple Coil:Cooling:DX:CurveFit:Speed objects. In the image below, the cooling coil has one single-speed operating mode and a second two-speed operating mode.
```

##  Field: Name

```
A unique user-assigned name for an instance of a cooling coil. Any reference to this cooling coil by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporator Inlet Node Name 
EvaporatorInletNodeName
```
The name of the HVAC system node from which the evaporator of the DX cooling coil draws its inlet air.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporator Outlet Node Name

```
The name of the HVAC system node to which the evaporator of the DX cooling coil sends its outlet air.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name

```
	
##  Field: Latent Capacity Time Constant 
LatentCapacityTimeConstant

Suggested value is 1000; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects (e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool), and this field as well as the previous three input fields for this object must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.
```
	
##  Field: Apply Latent Degradation to Speeds Greater than 1 
ApplyLatentDegradationToSpeedsGreaterThan1
```
This field determines whether latent capacity degradation is applied when the coil is operating at speeds greater than speed 1. The allowed choices are {Yes} or {No}, with the default being {No} if this field is left blank. Other input fields in this object allow the user to specify latent capacity degradation at each speed.
The latent capacity degradation model only applies when the ContinuousFanWithCyclingCompressor supply air fan operating mode is specified, to account for moisture evaporation from the wet cooling coil when the compressor cycles off but the supply air fan continues to operate. For the case of a single multi-speed compressor, latent capacity degradation may only be significant when the compressor cycles between speed 1 and off, but the losses may be extremely small when the compressor operates between speed 1 and speed 2 (or between speeds 2 and 3, etc.). In this case, the user may choose to specify {No} for this input field to neglect latent capacity degradation impacts at higher operating speeds. If latent capacity degradation is thought to be significant (e.g., intertwined or row-split cooling coil with multiple compressors feeding individual refrigerant circuits), then the user may choose to specify {Yes} and the latent capacity degradation model will be applied for speeds 2 through 10 as appropriate. The selection for this input field does not affect latent capacity degradation between speed 1 and off.

##  Field: Evaporative Condenser Pump Power Fraction

```
	
##  Field: Evaporative Condenser Effectiveness 
EvaporativeCondenserEffectiveness
```
The effectiveness of the evaporative condenser at a specific speed, which is used to determine the temperature of the air entering the outdoor condenser coil as follows:
Tcond,inlet =  \left( {Twb,o} \right)   +   \left( {1 - EvapCondEffectivenes} \right)\left( {Tdb,o   - Twb,o} \right)
where
{T_{cond,inlet}} = the temperature of the air entering the condenser coil (C)
{T_{wb,o}} = the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)
{T_{db,o}} = the dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)
The resulting condenser inlet air temperature is used by the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Function of Temperature Curve and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve. The default value for this field is 0.9, although valid entries can range from 0.0 to 1.0. This field is not used when Condenser Type = {AirCooled}.
If the user wants to model an air-cooled condenser, they should simply specify {AirCooled} in the field {Condenser Type}. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Function of Temperature Curve and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature.
If the user wishes to model an evaporative-cooled condenser AND they have performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = {EvaporativelyCooled} and the evaporative condenser effectiveness value should be entered as 1.0. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Function of Temperature Curve and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil.
If the user wishes to model an air-cooled condenser that has evaporative media placed in front of it to cool the air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = {EvaporativelyCooled}. The user must also enter the appropriate evaporative effectiveness for the media. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Function of Temperature Curve and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Be aware that the evaporative media will significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the condenser coil, so the Total Cooling Capacity and EIR Modifier Function of Air Flow Fraction Curves must be valid for the expected range of dry-bulb temperatures that will be entering the condenser coil.

If a univariate curve or table is specified, then the independent variable is the entering condenser temperature. The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44 °C (67 °F) indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35 °C (95 °F) outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the operating mode's {Rated Gross Total Cooling Capacity} to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures).

The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44 °C (67 °F) indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35 °C (95 °F) outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR for a specific speed (inverse of rated COP for a specific speed) to give the EIR for a specific speed at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures).

##  Field: Energy Input Ratio Modifier Function of Air Flow Fraction Curve Name 
EnergyInputRatioModifierFunctionOfAirFlowFractionCurveName
```
The name of a univariate (e.g. quadratic) curve or table object (ref Curve:* and Table:*) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) for a specific speed as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate for a specific speed (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR for a specific speed at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate for a specific speed.
```
	
##  Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name 
PartLoadFractionCorrelationCurveName
```
The name of a univariate (e.g. quadratic) curve or table object (ref Curve:* and Table:*) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity for a specific speed). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep for a specific speed. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.
The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 < = PLR < 1), the following rules apply:
       PLF > = 0.7     and     PLF > = PLR
If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.
A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional DX cooling coil (a specific speed) would be:
       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)
If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:
       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)

##  Field: Rated Waste Heat Fraction of Power Input 
RatedWasteHeatFractionOfPowerInput
```
The fraction of energy input to the cooling coil that is available as recoverable waste heat at full load and rated conditions for a specific speed.
```
	
##  Field: Waste Heat Modifier Function of Temperature Curve Name 
WasteHeatModifierFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
The name of a bivariate (e.g. biquadratic) curve or table object (ref Curve:* and Table:*) that parameterizes the variation of the waste heat recovery as a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature and the entering coil dry-bulb temperature at a specific speed. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated waste heat fraction at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point). The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point. When the fuel type is electricity, this field can remain blank since it is ignored by the program in this instance. When the fuel type is not electricity and the parent object AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed does not require waste heat calculations, this field is ignored. If the field is blank, a warning will be issued and simulation continues. When the fuel type is not electricity and the parent object AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed requires waste heat calculations, if this field is left blank, the program assumes a constant value of 1 to make simulation continue and a warning will be issued.

##  Field: Sensible Heat Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve Name 
SensibleHeatRatioModifierFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
The name of a bivariate (e.g. biquadratic) curve or table object (ref Curve:* and Table:*) that parameterizes the variation of the sensible heat ratio (SHR) as a function of DX cooling coil entering air wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated SHR and the SHR modifier curve (function of flow fraction) to give the SHR at the specific coil entering air temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rated condition. This input field is optional. If this input is not blank then the {Sensible Heat Ratio Modifier Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name} must also be entered. If left blank, SHR is calculated using the apparatus dew point method based on total capacity and coil bypass factor.

# CoolingTowerSingleSpeed

`CoolingTower:SingleSpeed`
```
Cooling towers are components that may be assigned to condenser loops. The cooling tower is modeled as a counterflow heat exchanger with a single-speed fan (induced draft configuration) based on Merkel's theory. The user must define tower performance via one of two methods: design heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or nominal tower capacity at a specific rating point. Regardless of which method is chosen, the design airflow rate and corresponding fan power must be specified. The model will also account for tower performance in the ``free convection'' regime, when the tower fan is off but the water pump remains on and heat transfer still occurs (albeit at a low level). If the user wants the model to account for ``free convection'', they must specify the corresponding airflow rate and heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA), or the nominal tower capacity during this mode of operation.
The cooling tower seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the {CondenserLoop} object. The model first checks to determine the impact of ``free convection'', if specified by the user, on the tower exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on ``free convection'' is at or below the set point, then the tower fan is not turned on. If the exiting water temperature based on ``free convection'' is below the set point, the tower will operate in FluidBypass mode -- portion of the water goes through the tower media and gets cooled while the remaining water flow gets bypassed, two water flows then mix together trying to meet the water setpoint temperature. If the exiting water temperature remains above the set point after ``free convection'' is modeled, then the tower fan is turned on to reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point. If the capacity control is FanCycling, the model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., tower fan on for the entire simulation timestep and tower fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account. If the capacity control is FluidBypass, the model determines the fraction of water flow to be bypassed while the remaining water goes through the tower cooling media and gets cooled, then the two water flows mix to meet the setpoint temperature. In this case, the fan runs at full speed for the entire timestep.
Cooling towers here are ``wet'' and consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the towers. The last six input fields are optional and provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specify connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a water storage tanks (i.e.~{WaterUse:Storage} objects).
For the operation of multi-cell towers, the first step is to determine the number of cells to operate based on the cell control method -- between the minimum number of cells subject to the maximum water flow rate fraction per cell, and maximum number of cells subject to the minimum water flow rate fraction per cell. If the calculated cells do not meet the loads, additional cells will be operating to help meet the loads. Inside each cell, the existing capacity controls still apply.
For multi-cell towers, the following inputs are assumed to be for the entire tower including all cells:
  Design Water Flow Rate; Design Air Flow Rate; Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;
  Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime; Nominal Capacity; Free Convection Capacity
  BASIN HEATER (we assume that there is a common basin)
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower.
```
	
##  Field: Water Inlet Node Name 
WaterInletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water inlet node.
```
	
##  Field: Water Outlet Node Name 
WaterOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water outlet node.
```
	
##  Field: Design Water Flow Rate 
DesignWaterFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the tower in m^{3}/s. This value is the flow rate of the condenser loop water being cooled by the tower (not the flow rate of water being sprayed on the outside of the heat exchange coil). If the input field ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then a water flow rate greater than zero must be defined or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design water flow rate is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections). If ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``NominalCapacity'', then this field must be left blank since the model automatically assumes a water flow rate of 5.382E-8 m3/s per watt (3 gpm/ton) of tower capacity specified in the field ``Nominal Capacity''.
```
	
##  Field: Design Air Flow Rate 
DesignAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the design air flow rate induced by the tower fan in m^{3}/s. A value greater than zero must be defined regardless of the tower performance input method. Alternately, this field can be autosized. If autosized, the design air flow rate is calculated as follows:
Design Air Flow Rate = \frac{{0.5{ρ_{air}}(Fan power at Design Air Flow Rate)}}{{190.}}
where a fan pressure rise of 190 Pascals and total fan efficiency of 0.5 are assumed.
```
	
##  Field: Design Fan Power 
DesignFanPower
```
This numeric field contains the fan power (in watts) at the design air flow rate specified in the previous field. A value greater than zero must be specified regardless of the tower performance input method, or this field can be autosized. If autosized, the fan power is calculated as follows:
If``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``{UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate}'', then
Fan power = 0.0105⋅ {ρ_{water}}⋅ {C_{p,water}}⋅ Design Water Flow Rate⋅ Design LoopΔ T
is used.
If``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``{NominalCapacity}'', then
Fan power = 0.0105⋅ Tower Nominal Capacity
is used.
```
	
##  Field: Design U-Factor Times Area Value 
DesignUFactorTimesAreaValue
```
This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) in watts per Kelvin corresponding to the design air and water flow rates specified above. If the input field ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then a UA value greater than zero but less than or equal to 300,000 must be defined, or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design tower UA value is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections), assuming a tower water inlet temperature of 35C and tower inlet air at 35C drybulb/25.6C wetbulb. If ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``NominalCapacity'', then this field must be left blank since the model automatically calculates the tower UA based on the tower capacity specified in the field ``Nominal Capacity''.
```
	
##  Field: Free Convection Regime Air Flow Rate 
FreeConvectionRegimeAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the air flow rate (m^{3}/s) when the tower is in the ``free convection'' regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off). This value must be less than the value specified for the field ``Design Air Flow Rate''. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the ``Design Air Flow Rate'' determined in the following input field. If the user does not wish to model ``free convection'' and is using the Performance Input Method ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then this field should be set to 0.0. If the user specifies the U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate or Free Convection Capacity as a value greater than zero, then the free convection air flow rate must be specified greater than 0.0.
```
	
##  Field: Free Convection Regime Air Flow Rate Sizing Factor 
FreeConvectionRegimeAirFlowRateSizingFactor
```
This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the free convection regime air flow rate.~ The default is 0.1.
```
	
##  Field: Free Convection Regime U-Factor Times Area Value 
FreeConvectionRegimeUFactorTimesAreaValue
```
This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (W/K) when the tower is in the ``free convection'' regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off). This value must be less than the value specified for the field ``U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate''. This field may be autosized, in which case it is set to a fraction of the ``U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate'' determined in the following input field. If the user does not wish to model ``free convection'' and is using the~ Performance Input Method ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then this field should be set to 0.0. If ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``NominalCapacity'', then this field must be left blank since the model automatically calculates the tower UA based on the tower capacity specified in the field ``Free Convection Capacity''.\textbackslash{}
```
	
##  Field: Free Convection U-Factor Times Area Value Sizing Factor 
FreeConvectionUFactorTimesAreaValueSizingFactor
```
This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the free convection regime U-Factor times area value.~ The default is 0.1.
```
	
##  Field: Performance Input Method 
PerformanceInputMethod
```
This alpha field contains the method by which the user will specify tower performance: ``{UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate}'' or ``{NominalCapacity}''. If this field is left blank in the input data file, the default input method is assumed to be ``{UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate}''. If the method ``{UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate}'' is selected, then the user must enter design UA values, design water flow rates and air flow rates as described for the previous input fields. If the method ``NominalCapacity'' is selected then the fields ``Design Water Flow Rate'', ``U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate'' and ``U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate'' must be left blank, but the fields ``Nominal Capacity'' and ``Free Convection Capacity'' must be entered as described below.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio 
HeatRejectionCapacityAndNominalCapacitySizingRatio
```
This numeric field contains the value for the ratio of actual tower heat rejection to nominal capacity.~ This ratio is defined at entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. Historically this ratio has been set at 1.25 based on the assumption that the tower must dissipate 0.25 W of compressor power for every what of heat removed at the chiller evaporator.~ The default is 1.25.
```
	
##  Field: Nominal Capacity 
NominalCapacity
```
This numeric input field contains the ``nominal'' heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower in watts, with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m^{3}/s per watt of nominal capacity (3 gpm/ton). The value in the previous field times this nominal tower capacity gives the actual tower heat rejection at these operating conditions (based on historical assumption that the tower must dissipate additional heat from the compressor heat for heat removed at the evaporator).
```
	
##  Field: Free Convection Capacity 
FreeConvectionCapacity
```
This numeric input field contains the ``nominal'' heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower in watts when the tower is in the ``free convection'' regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off), with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m^{3}/s per watt of nominal tower capacity (input field above). The heat rejection capacity and nominal capacity sizing ratio is applied tof this free convection tower capacity to give the actual tower heat rejection at these operating conditions (typical value is 1.25 based on historical assumption that the tower must dissipate 0.25W of compressor heat for every watt of heat removed by the evaporator). The value specified for this field must be less than the value specified for the field ``Tower Nominal Capacity''. If the user does not wish to model ``free convection'', then this field should be set to 0.0. If the user specifies a value greater than zero, then the ``Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime'' field must contain a value greater than zero. This field can be automatically calculated using the sizing factor in the following field.
```
	
##  Field: Free Convection Nominal Capacity Sizing Factor 
FreeConvectionNominalCapacitySizingFactor
```
This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the Free Convection Capacity. The default is 0.1.
```
	
##  Field: Design Inlet Air Dry-Bulb Temperature 
DesignInletAirDryBulbTemperature
```
This numeric field specifies the design inlet air dry-bulb temperature of the tower. The default is {35.0}°C.
```
	
##  Field: Design Inlet Air Wet-Bulb Temperature 
DesignInletAirWetBulbTemperature
```
This numeric field specifies the design inlet air wet-bulb temperature of the tower. The default is {25.6}°C.
```
	
##  Field: Design Approach Temperature 
DesignApproachTemperature
```
This numeric field specifies the design approach temperature of the tower corresponding to the design inlet air wet-bulb temperature and the design temperature range.
The approach temperature should be the outlet water temperature minus the inlet air wet-bulb temperature at design conditions.
This parameter is autosizable and when autosized it is set to {3.9}°C.
```
	
##  Field: Design Temperature Range 
DesignTemperatureRange
```
This numeric field specifies the design temperature range of the tower corresponding to the design inlet air wet-bulb temperature and the design approach temperature.
The design range  should be the inlet water temperature minus the outlet water temperature at design conditions.
This parameter is autosizable and when autosized it is set to {5.5}°C.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Capacity 
BasinHeaterCapacity
```
This numeric field contains the capacity of the tower's electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature 
BasinHeaterSetpointTemperature
```
This numeric field contains the set point temperature (°C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2°C, and the default value is 2°C if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name 
BasinHeaterOperatingScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the cooling tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporation Loss Mode 
EvaporationLossMode
```
This field is used to choose which method is used to model the amount of water evaporated by the cooling tower. There are two options: {LossFactor} or {SaturatedExit}. The default is SaturatedExit. The user-defined loss factor is entered in the following field. By assuming that the air leaving the tower is saturated, the evaporation can be directly calculated using moist air engineering calculations with data available within the cooling tower model (and does not require additional user input).
```
	
##  Field: Evaporation Loss Factor 
EvaporationLossFactor
```
This field is used to specify the rate of water evaporated from the cooling tower and lost to the outside air [percent/K]. This field is only used if the Evaporation Calculation Mode is set to {LossFactor}. The evaporation loss is then calculated as a fraction of the circulating condenser water flow and varies with the temperature change in the condenser water. The value entered here is in units of percent-per-degree Kelvin. The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water. Typical values are from 0.15 to 0.27 [percent/K]. The default is 0.2.
```
	
##  Field: Drift Loss Percent 
DriftLossPercent
```
This field is used to specify the rate of water lost to the exiting air as entrained droplets [%]. The drift loss is a percent of the condenser water flow. Typical values for towers with efficient drift eliminators are between 0.002 and 0.2% of the condenser water flow rate. The default value is 0.008%.
```
	
##  Field: Blowdown Calculation Mode 
BlowdownCalculationMode
```
This field specifies which method is used to determine blowdown rates. There two options {ConcentrationRatio} or {ScheduledRate}. The choice will determine which of the two models below is used. The default is ConcentrationRatio.
```
	
##  Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio 
BlowdownConcentrationRatio
```
This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the cooling tower as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the tower in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Typical values for tower operation are 3 to 5. The default value is 3.
```
	
##  Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name 
BlowdownMakeupWaterUsageScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m^{3}/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the tower of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. This schedule is only used if the Blowdown Calculation Mode is set to ScheduledRate. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Typical values range from 0.0002 to 0.0013 m^{3}/s (17.3 to 112.3 m^{3}/day). This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the cooling tower is active and water is flowing through the tower (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).
```
	
##  Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name 
SupplyWaterStorageTankName
```
This field is optional. It is used to describe where the tower obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the tower will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a {WaterUse:Storage} object is used here, then the tower will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the tower will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the tower needs, then the tower will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as `Starved' water).
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name 
OutdoorAirInletNodeName
```
This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the cooling tower. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air conditions entering the cooling tower are taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an {OutdoorAir:NodeList} object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.
```
	
##  Field:Capacity Control 
CapacityControl
```
This alpha field contains the cooling capacity control for the cooling tower. Two choices are available: {FanCycling} and {FluidBypass}. During part-load conditions, there are two ways to maintain the exiting water temperature at the setpoint: either cycling the tower fan, or bypassing portion of the tower water with a three-way valve. For FluidBypass, the tower fan still runs at full speed for the entire timestep, but only portion of the water flow goes through the cooling tower media to get cooled while the remaining portion of the water flow gets bypassed. Two water flows then mix at the common water sump to meet the setpoint temperature.
```
	
##  Field: Number of Cells 
NumberOfCells
```
This integer field contains the number of cells in the multi-cell cooling tower. If not entered, the program will assume it is a single-cell cooling tower
```
	
##  Field: Cell Control 
CellControl
```
This alpha field specifies the method used to control the number of cells used to meet the load, the two choices are:
{MinimalCell} : the program will use minimal number of cells needed, all other cells will be shut down with no water flow. It will attempt to use as few cells as possible to cool the fluid. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to exceed its maximum value defined by the {Maximum Water Flow Rate Fraction.}
{MaximalCell}: As many cells as possible will be turned on. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to drop below its minimum value specified by the {Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction}.
If this field is left blank, the default value is {MaximalCell}.
```
	
##  Field: Cell Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction 
CellMinimumWaterFlowRateFraction
```
This numeric field specifies the allowable smallest fraction of the design water flow rate. Flows less than this value will commonly result in fluid distribution problems; the pressure at each nozzle will be too weak for the fluid to be sprayed out in the correct pattern, not all the fill would be wet. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.33.
```
	
##  Field: Cell Maximum~ Water Flow Rate Fraction 
CellMaximumWaterFlowRateFraction
```
This numeric field specifies the allowable largest fraction of the design water flow rate. If this field is left blank, the default value is 2.5.
```
	
##  Field: Sizing Factor 
SizingFactor
```
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are:
1.~~~~Design Water Flow Rate;
2.~~~~Design Air Flow Rate;
3.~~~~Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;
4.~~~~U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate;
5.~~~~Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime;
6.~~~~U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate.
Note that the U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate is not {multiplied} by the Sizing Factor. Instead the design tower load is multiplied by the sizing factor and the design UA then calculated as usual. The U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate is set to 10% of the new design Tower UA.
```
	
##  Field: End-Use Subcategory 
EndUseSubcategory
```
This optional field allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Process''. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref: {Output:Meter} objects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the cooling tower will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

# CoolingTowerTwoSpeed

`CoolingTower:TwoSpeed`
```
The two-speed cooling tower is modeled in a similar fashion to the single-speed tower. The cooling tower is modeled as a counterflow heat exchanger with a two-speed fan (induced draft configuration) based on Merkel's theory. The user must define tower performance via one of two methods: heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or nominal tower capacity at a specific rating point. Regardless of which method is chosen, the airflow rate and corresponding fan power at both high and low fan speed must be specified. The model will also account for tower performance in the ``free convection'' regime, when the tower fan is off but the water pump remains on and heat transfer still occurs (albeit at a low level). If the user wants the model to account for ``free convection'', they must specify the corresponding air flow rate and heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA), or the nominal tower capacity during this mode of operation.
The cooling tower seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the {CondenserLoop} object. The model first checks to determine the impact of ``free convection'', if specified by the user, on the tower exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on ``free convection'' is at or below the set point, then the tower fan is not turned on. If the exiting water temperature remains above the set point after ``free convection'' is modeled, then the tower fan is turned on at low speed to reduce the exiting water temperature. If operating the tower fan at low speed does not reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point, then the tower fan is increased to its high speed.
The model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., tower fan at high speed for the entire simulation timestep and tower fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep, or tower fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep and tower fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account.
Cooling towers here are ``wet'' and consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the towers. The last six input fields are optional and provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specifiy connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a {WaterUse:Storage} object.
For the operation of multi-cell towers, the first step is to determine the number of cells to operate based on the cell control method -- between the minimum number of cells subject to the maximum water flow rate fraction per cell, and maximum number of cells subject to the minimum water flow rate fraction per cell. If the calculated cells do not meet the loads, additional cells will be operating to help meet the loads. Inside each cell, the existing capacity controls still apply.
For multi-cell towers, the following inputs are assumed to be for the entire tower including all cells:
  Design Water Flow Rate; Design Air Flow Rate; Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;
  Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime; Nominal Capacity; Free Convection Capacity
  BASIN HEATER (we assume that there is a common basin)

##  Field: Name

```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower.
```
	
##  Field: Water Inlet Node Name 
WaterInletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water inlet node.
```
	
##  Field: Water Outlet Node Name 
WaterOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water outlet node.
```
	
##  Field: Design Water Flow Rate 
DesignWaterFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the tower in m^{3}/s. This value is the flow rate of the condenser loop water being cooled by the tower (not the flow rate of water being sprayed on the outside of the heat exchange coil). If the input field ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then a water flow rate greater than zero must be defined or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design water flow rate is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections). If ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``NominalCapacity'', then this field must be left blank since the model automatically assumes a design water flow rate of 5.382E-8 m3/s per watt (3 gpm/ton) of tower capacity specified in the field ``Tower High-Speed Nominal Capacity''.
```
	
##  Field: High Fan Speed Air Flow Rate

```
This numeric field contains the tower air flow rate at high fan speed in m^{3}/s. A value greater than zero must be defined regardless of the tower performance input method. Alternately, this field can be autosized. If autosized, the design air flow rate is calculated as follows:
Air Flow Rate at High Fan Speed  =  \frac{{0.5{ρ_{air}}(Fan Power at High Fan Speed )}}{{190.}}
where a fan pressure rise of 190 Pascals and total fan efficiency of 0.5 are assumed.
{{Field: High Fan Speed Fan Power}}
This numeric field contains the fan power (in Watts) at the high-speed air flow rate specified in the previous field. A value greater than zero must be specified regardless of the tower performance input method, or this field can be autosized. If autosized, the fan power is calculated as follows:

Fan powe{r_{High Fan Speed}} = 0.0105⋅ {ρ_{water}}⋅ {C_{p,water}}⋅ Design Water Flow Rate⋅ Design LoopΔ T

If the input field ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then a UA value greater than zero but less than or equal to 300,000 must be defined, or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the tower UA value at high fan speed is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections), assuming a tower water inlet temperature of 35C and tower inlet air at 35C drybulb/25.6C wetbulb. If ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``NominalCapacity'', then this field must be left blank since the model automatically calculates the tower UA based on the capacity specified in the field ``High-Speed Nominal Capacity''.

This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the ``U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed'' determined in the following field.

This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the cooling tower as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the tower in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Typical values for tower operation are 3 to 5. The default value is 3.
```
	
##  Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name 
BlowdownMakeupWaterUsageScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m^{3}/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the tower of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. This schedule is only used if the Blowdown Calculation mode is set to ScheduledRate. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Typical values range from 0.0002 to 0.0013 m^{3}/s (17.3 to 112.3 m^{3}/day). This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the cooling tower is active and water is flowing through the tower (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).
```
	
##  Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name 
SupplyWaterStorageTankName
```
This field is optional. It is used to describe where the tower obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the tower will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a {WaterUse:Storage} object is used here, then the tower will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the tower will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the tower needs, then the tower will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as `Starved' water).
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name 
OutdoorAirInletNodeName
```
This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the cooling tower. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air conditions entering the cooling tower are taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an {OutdoorAir:NodeList} object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.
```
	
##  Field: Number of Cells 
NumberOfCells
```
This integer field contains the number of cells in the multi-cell cooling tower. If not entered, the program will assume it is a single-cell cooling tower
```
	
##  Field: Cell Control 
CellControl
```
This alpha field specifies the method used to control the number of cells used to meet the load, the two choices are:
{MinimalCell}: the program will use minimal number of cells needed, all other cells will be shut down with no water flow. It will attempt to use as few cells as possible to cool the fluid. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to exceed its maximum value defined by the {Maximum Water Flow Rate Fraction.}
{MaximalCell}: As many cells as possible will be turned on. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to drop below its minimum value specified by the {Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction}.
If this field is left blank, the default value is {MaximalCell}.
```
	
##  Field: Cell Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction 
CellMinimumWaterFlowRateFraction
```
This numeric field specifies the allowable smallest fraction of the design water flow rate. Flows less than this value will commonly result in fluid distribution problems; the pressure at each nozzle will be too weak for the fluid to be sprayed out in the correct pattern, not all the fill would be wet. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.33.
```
	
##  Field: Cell Maximum~ Water Flow Rate Fraction 
CellMaximumWaterFlowRateFraction
```
This numeric field specifies the allowable largest fraction of the design water flow rate. If this field is left blank, the default value is 2.5.
```
	
##  Field: Sizing Factor 
SizingFactor
```
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are:
1.~~~~Design Water Flow Rate;
2.~~~~Air Flow Rate at High Fan Speed;
3.~~~~Fan Power at High Fan Speed;
4.~~~~U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed;
5.~~~~Air Flow Rate at Low Fan Speed;
6.~~~~Fan Power at Low Fan Speed;
7.~~~~U-Factor Times Area Value at Low Fan Speed;
8.~~~~Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime;
9.~~~~U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate.
Note that the U-Factor Times Area Value at High Fan Speed is not {multiplied} by the Sizing Factor. Instead the design tower load is multiplied by the sizing factor and the design UA then calculated as usual. The U-Factor Times Area Value at Low Fan Speed is set to a fraction of the full load design UA determined by the field Low Fan Speed U-Factor Times Area Sizing Factor. The U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate is set to a fraction of the design Tower UA determined by the field Free Convection Air U-Factor Times Area Value Sizing Factor.
```
	
##  Field: End-Use Subcategory 
EndUseSubcategory
```
This optional field allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Process''. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref: {Output:Meter} objects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the cooling tower will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

# CoolingTowerVariableSpeedMerkel

`CoolingTower:VariableSpeed:Merkel`
```
This variable speed tower model is based on Merkel's theory and is similar to the single-speed and two-speed tower models.~ The open wet cooling tower is modeled as a counter flow heat exchanger with a variable-speed fan drawing air through the tower (induced-draft configuration). The model also includes a ``free convection'' regime where cooling tower performance is modeled with the fan off.
For this model, Merkel's theory is modified to include adjustments developed by Scheier to alter the heat transfer effectiveness based on current wetbulb, air flow rates, and water flow rates. The input requires performance curves or lookup tables to describe these three adjustment factors.
For a multi-cell tower, the capacity and air/water flow rate inputs are for the entire tower.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower.
```
	
##  Field: Water Inlet Node Name 
WaterInletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water inlet node.
```
	
##  Field: Water Outlet Node Name 
WaterOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the cooling tower's water outlet node.
```
	
##  Field: Performance Input Method 
PerformanceInputMethod
```
This alpha field contains the method by which the user will specify tower performance: ``{UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate}'' or ``{NominalCapacity}''.
If this field is left blank in the input data file, the default input method is assumed to be ``{NominalCapacity}''.
If the method ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'' is selected, then the user must enter design UA values, design water flow rates and air flow rates as described for the previous input fields.
If the method ``NominalCapacity'' is selected then the fields ``Design Water Flow Rate'', ``U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate'' and ``U-Factor Times Area Value at Free Convection Air Flow Rate'' must be left blank, but the fields ``Nominal Capacity'' and ``Free Convection Capacity'' must be entered as described below.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio 
HeatRejectionCapacityAndNominalCapacitySizingRatio
```
This numeric field contains the value for the ratio of actual tower heat rejection to nominal capacity.~ This ratio is defined at entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. Historically this ratio has been set at 1.25 based on the assumption that the tower must dissipate 0.25 W of compressor power for every what of heat removed at the chiller evaporator.~ The default is 1.25.
```
	
##  Field: Nominal Capacity 
NominalCapacity
```
This numeric input field contains the ``nominal'' heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower in watts under full-speed fan operation, with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio set in the previous field is applied to this nominal tower capacity to give the actual tower heat rejection at these operating conditions.~ This field can be autosized, in which case a {Sizing:Plant} object is needed for the condenser loop.
```
	
##  Field: Free Convection Nominal Capacity 
FreeConvectionNominalCapacity
```
This numeric input field contains the ``nominal'' heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower in watts when the tower is in the ``free convection'' regime (water flow exists but tower fan is turned off), with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio is applied to this free convection tower capacity to give the actual tower heat rejection at these operating conditions.The value specified for this field must be less than the value specified for the field ``Tower Low-Speed Nominal Capacity''. If the user does not wish to model ``free convection'', then this field should be set to 0.0. If the user specifies a value greater than zero, then the ``Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime'' field must contain a value greater than zero. This field may be autocalculated, in which case it is set to a fraction of the High Speed Nominal Capacity determined in the following field.
```
	
##  Field: Free Convection Nominal Capacity Sizing Factor 
FreeConvectionNominalCapacitySizingFactor
```
This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the Free Convection Capacity. The default is 0.1.
```
	
##  Field: Design Water Flow Rate 
DesignWaterFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the tower in m^{3}/s. This value is the flow rate of the condenser loop water being cooled by the tower. If the input field ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then a water flow rate greater than zero must be defined or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a {Sizing:Plant} object must be defined and the design water flow rate is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections). If ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``NominalCapacity'', then this field can be autocalculated using the sizing factor in the following field.
```
	
##  Field: Design Water Flow Rate per Unit of Nominal Capacity 
DesignWaterFlowRatePerUnitOfNominalCapacity
```
This numeric field contains a scalable sizing factor for design water flow rate that scales with nominal capacity, in units of m^{3}/s/W. The default value is 5.382*10^{-8}. This field is only used if the previous field is set to autocalculate and performance input method is NominalCapacity.~ (If the performance input method is set to UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate then the design water flow rate is obtained from the plant sizing result.)
```
	
##  Field: Design Air Flow Rate 
DesignAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the tower air flow rate at full fan speed, in m^{3}/s.~ The value can be autocalculated, in which case the air flow rate is based off of the scalable sizing factor in the following input field.
```
	
##  Field: Design Air Flow Rate Per Unit of Nominal Capacity 
DesignAirFlowRatePerUnitOfNominalCapacity
```
This numeric field contains the sizing factor to use when calculating the design air flow rate from the nominal capacity, in units of m^{3}/s/W.~ The default is 2.76316*10^{-5}.~ When this field is left blank, then the default value is used but the flow rate is also scaled to account for elevation (with larger volume flow rates at higher altitudes).~ When a hard value is entered, even if it is the same as the default, then the design air flow rate is not also adjusted for elevation and the scaling factor is used directly.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Air Flow Rate Ratio 
MinimumAirFlowRateRatio
```
This numeric field contains the minimum air flow rate ratio. The tower fan is allowed to operate between the ratio defined here and a maximum air flow rate ratio of 1.0 (which corresponds to the design [maximum] tower air flow rate). Below this value the tower is assumed to operate in the ``free convection'' regime with the tower fan off. The minimum air flow rate ratio must be greater than or equal to 0.1 and less than or equal to 0.5, with a default value of 0.2 if the field is left blank.

##  Field: Design Fan Power 
DesignFanPower
```
This numeric field contains the fan power in watts at the design (maximum) air flow rate through the tower. A value greater than zero must be specified or this field can be autocalculated.

```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Capacity 
BasinHeaterCapacity
```
This numeric field contains the capacity of the tower's electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature 
BasinHeaterSetpointTemperature
```
This numeric field contains the set point temperature (°C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2°C, and the default value is 2°C if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name 
BasinHeaterOperatingScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the cooling tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporation Loss Mode 
EvaporationLossMode
```
This field is used to choose which method is used to model the amount of water evaporated by the cooling tower. There are two options: {LossFactor} or {SaturatedExit}. The default is SaturatedExit. The user-defined loss factor is entered in the following field. By assuming that the air leaving the tower is saturated, the evaporation can be directly calculated using moist air engineering calculations with data available within the cooling tower model (and does not require additional user input).
```
	
##  Field: Evaporation Loss Factor 
EvaporationLossFactor
```
This field is used to specify the rate of water evaporated from the cooling tower and lost to the outside air [percent/K]. This field is only used if the Evaporation Calculation Mode is set to {LossFactor}. The evaporation loss is then calculated as a fraction of the circulating condenser water flow and varies with the temperature change in the condenser water. The value entered here is in units of percent-per-degree Kelvin. The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water. Typical values are from 0.15 to 0.27 [percent/K]. The default is 0.2.
```
	
##  Field: Drift Loss Percent 
DriftLossPercent
```
This field is used to specify the rate of water lost to the exiting air as entrained droplets [%]. The drift loss is a percent of the condenser water flow. Typical values for towers with efficient drift eliminators are between 0.002 and 0.2% of the condenser water flow rate. The default value is 0.008%.
```
	
##  Field: Blowdown Calculation Mode 
BlowdownCalculationMode
```
This field specifies which method is used to determine blowdown rates. There two options {ConcentrationRatio} or {ScheduledRate}. The choice will determine which of the two models below is used. The default is ConcentrationRatio.
```
	
##  Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio 
BlowdownConcentrationRatio
```
This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the cooling tower as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the tower in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Typical values for tower operation are 3 to 5. The default value is 3.
```
	
##  Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name 
BlowdownMakeupWaterUsageScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m^{3}/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the tower of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. This schedule is only used if the Blowdown Calculation Mode is set to ScheduledRate. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Typical values range from 0.0002 to 0.0013 m^{3}/s (17.3 to 112.3 m^{3}/day). This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the cooling tower is active and water is flowing through the tower (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).
```
	
##  Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name 
SupplyWaterStorageTankName
```
This field is optional. It is used to describe where the tower obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the tower will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a {WaterUse:Storage} object is used here, then the tower will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the tower will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the tower needs, then the tower will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as `Starved' water).
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name 
OutdoorAirInletNodeName
```
This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the cooling tower. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air conditions entering the cooling tower are taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an {OutdoorAir:NodeList} object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.
```
	
##  Field: Number of Cells 
NumberOfCells
```
This integer field contains the number of cells in the multi-cell cooling tower. If not entered, the program will assume it is a single-cell cooling tower
```
	
##  Field: Cell Control 
CellControl
```
This alpha field specifies the method used to control the number of cells used to meet the load, the two choices are:
{MinimalCell} : the program will use minimal number of cells needed, all other cells will be shut down with no water flow. It will attempt to use as few cells as possible to cool the fluid. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to exceed its maximum value defined by the {Maximum Water Flow Rate Fraction.}
{MaximalCell}: As many cells as possible will be turned on. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to drop below its minimum value specified by the {Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction}.
If this field is left blank, the default value is {MaximalCell}.
```
	
##  Field: Cell Minimum~ Water Flow Rate Fraction 
CellMinimumWaterFlowRateFraction
```
This numeric field specifies the allowable smallest fraction of the design water flow rate. Flows less than this value will commonly result in fluid distribution problems; the pressure at each nozzle will be too weak for the fluid to be sprayed out in the correct pattern, not all the fill would be wet. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.33.
```
	
##  Field: Cell Maximum Water Flow Rate Fraction 
CellMaximumWaterFlowRateFraction
```
This numeric field specifies the allowable largest fraction of the design water flow rate. If this field is left blank, the default value is 2.5.
```
	
##  Field: Sizing Factor 
SizingFactor
```
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.
```
	
##  Field: End-Use Subcategory 
EndUseSubcategory
```
This optional field allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Process''. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref: {Output:Meter} objects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the cooling tower will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

# CoolingTowerVariableSpeed

`CoolingTower:VariableSpeed`
```
The variable speed tower model is based on empirical curve fits of manufacturer's performance data or field measurements. The user specifies tower performance at design conditions, and empirical curves are used to determine the approach temperature and fan power at off-design conditions. The user defines tower performance by entering the inlet air wet-bulb temperature, tower range, and tower approach temperature at the design conditions. The corresponding water flow rate (within ??25% of the tower's rated water mass flow rate), air flow rate, and fan power must also be specified. The model will account for tower performance in the ``free convection'' regime, when the tower fan is off but the water pump remains on and heat transfer still occurs (albeit at a low level). Basin heater operation and makeup water usage (due to evaporation, drift, and blowdown) are also modeled.
The cooling tower seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the {CondenserLoop} object. The model first checks to determine the impact of ``free convection'' on the tower exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on ``free convection'' is at or below the set point, then the variable-speed tower fan is not turned on. If the exiting water temperature is above the set point after ``free convection'' is modeled, then the variable-speed tower fan is turned on to reduce the exiting water temperature. Tower fan power is calculated based on the tower air flow rate required to achieve the exiting water set point temperature.
Cooling towers here are ``wet'' and consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the towers. The last six input fields are optional and provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specifiy connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a {WaterUse:Storage} object.
For the operation of multi-cell towers, the first step is to determine the number of cells to operate based on the cell control method -- between the minimum number of cells subject to the maximum water flow rate fraction per cell, and maximum number of cells subject to the minimum water flow rate fraction per cell. If the calculated cells do not meet the loads, additional cells will be operating to help meet the loads. Inside each cell, the existing capacity controls still apply.
For multi-cell towers, the following inputs are assumed to be for the entire tower including all cells:
  Design Water Flow Rate; Design Air Flow Rate; Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;
  Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime; Nominal Capacity; Free Convection Capacity
  BASIN HEATER (we assume that there is a common basin)

The design range temperature should correspond with the design values for inlet air wet-bulb temperature, approach temperature, water flow rate, and air flow rate specified for this tower. The value for this field must be greater than 0°C and the default value is 5.6°C if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Design Water Flow Rate 
DesignWaterFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the tower in m^{3}/s. The value entered should be within ??25% of the tower's rated water mass flow rate as specified by the manufacturer if Model Type is ``CoolToolsCrossFlow'' or ``YorkCalc''. This constraint may be different for Model Type ``CoolToolsUserDefined'' or ``YorkCalcUserDefined'' (ref. {CoolingTowerPerformance:CoolTools} or {CoolingTowerPerformance:YorkCalc}).
This value is the flow rate of the condenser loop water being cooled by the tower. A value greater than zero must be specified or this field can be autosized. A Plant Sizing object must be defined if the field is autosized and the design water flow rate is then derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections). The design water flow rate should correspond with the design values specified for the inlet air wet-bulb temperature, approach temperature, range temperature, and air flow rate. When this field is not autosized, the condenser loop flow rate specified in other objects should be within ??25% of the tower's rated water flow rate (different range is permissible if Model Type is ``User Defined'').
```
	
##  Field: Design Air Flow Rate 
DesignAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the design (maximum) air flow rate through the tower in m^{3}/s. A value greater than zero must be specified or this field can be autosized. Autosizing of this field does not require a Plant Sizing object since the design air flow rate is assumed to be the design fan power multiplied by a total fan efficiency of 0.5 and divided by a fan pressure rise of 190 Pascals. A correction for altitude is also included as follows:
Design Air Flow Rate = \frac{{0.5(Fan power at Design Air Flow Rate)}}{{190.}}left( {\frac{{101325.}}{{{P_{atm}}}}} \right)
```
	
##  Field: Design Fan Power 
DesignFanPower
```
This numeric field contains the fan power in watts at the design (maximum) air flow rate through the tower. A value greater than zero must be specified or this field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the fan power is calculated as follows:
Design fan power = 0.0105⋅ {ρ_{water}}⋅ {C_{p,water}}⋅ Design Water Flow Rate⋅ Design LoopΔ T
```
	
##  Field: Fan Power Ratio Function of Air Flow Rate Ratio Curve Name 
FanPowerRatioFunctionOfAirFlowRateRatioCurveName
```
This alpha field contains the curve object name for fan power ratio (fan power/design fan power) as a function of air flow rate ratio (air flow rate/design air flow rate) [ref. Performance Curves]. The curve object must be a cubic curve and should be normalized to 1.0 at an air flow rate ratio of 1.0. If this field is left blank, a theoretical fan curve is assumed where fan power ratio is directly proportional to the air flow rate ratio cubed.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Air Flow Rate Ratio 
MinimumAirFlowRateRatio
```
This numeric field contains the minimum air flow rate ratio. The tower fan is allowed to operate between the ratio defined here and a maximum air flow rate ratio of 1.0 (which corresponds to the design [maximum] tower air flow rate). Below this value, the tower is assumed to operate either in the ``free convection'' regime with the tower fan off, or the tower fan is cycled on/off to maintain the exiting water set point temperature. The minimum air flow rate ratio must be greater than or equal to 0.2 and less than or equal to 0.5, with a default value of 0.2 if the field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Fraction of Tower Capacity in Free Convection Regime 
FractionOfTowerCapacityInFreeConvectionRegime
```
This numeric field contains the fraction of tower capacity available in the free convection regime (i.e., when the tower fan is off but water continues to flow through the tower). The tower fan does not operate when the free convection tower capacity is able to meet or exceed the exiting water set point temperature. The air flow rate through the tower in the free convection regime is assumed to be this same fraction of the tower design air flow rate. The fraction of tower capacity in free convection regime must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 0.2, with a default value of 0.125 if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Capacity 
BasinHeaterCapacity
```
This numeric field contains the capacity of the tower's electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature 
BasinHeaterSetpointTemperature
```
This numeric field contains the set point temperature (°C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2°C, and the default value is 2°C if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name 
BasinHeaterOperatingScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the cooling tower fan is off and water is not flowing through the tower.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporation Loss Mode 
EvaporationLossMode
```
This field is used to choose which method is used to model the amount of water evaporated by the cooling tower. There are two options: {LossFactor} or {SaturatedExit}. The default is SaturatedExit. The user-defined loss factor is entered in the following field. By assuming that the air leaving the tower is saturated, the evaporation can be directly calculated using moist air engineering calculations with data available within the cooling tower model (and does not require additional user input).
```
	
##  Field: Evaporation Loss Factor 
EvaporationLossFactor
```
This field is used to specify the rate of water evaporated from the cooling tower and lost to the outside air [percent/K]. This field is only used if the Evaporation Calculation Mode is set to LossFactor. The evaporation loss is then calculated as a fraction of the circulating condenser water flow and varies with the temperature change in the condenser water. The value entered here is in units of percent-per-degree Kelvin. The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water. Typical values are from 0.15 to 0.27 [percent/K]. The default is 0.2.
```
	
##  Field: Drift Loss Percent 
DriftLossPercent
```
This numeric field contains the percent (%) of design water flow rate lost to the atmosphere at the design air flow rate due to drift, which is water droplets that are entrained in the airstream as it passes through the tower. Drift is assumed to vary directly with tower air flow rate ratio, and is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or blowdown. Typical values for water usage due to drift are from 0.05 to 0.2% of the total water circulation rate with currently-available drift eliminators from tower manufacturers. The value entered in this field must be greater than or equal to zero, and the default value is 0.008%.
```
	
##  Field: Blowdown Calculation Mode 
BlowdownCalculationMode
```
This field specifies which method is used to determine blowdown rates. There two options `ConcentrationRatio' or `ScheduledRate'. The choice will determine which of the two models below is used. The default is ConcentrationRatio.
```
	
##  Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio 
BlowdownConcentrationRatio
```
This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the cooling tower as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the tower in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Typical values for tower operation are 3 to 5. The default value is 3.
```
	
##  Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name 
BlowdownMakeupWaterUsageScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m^{3}/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the condenser loop of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Typical values range from 0.0002 to 0.0013 m^{3}/s (17.3 to 112.3 m^{3}/day). This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the cooling tower is active and water is flowing through the tower (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).
```
	
##  Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name 
SupplyWaterStorageTankName
```
This field is optional. It is used to describe where the tower obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the tower will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a WaterUser:Storage object is used here, then the tower will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the tower will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the tower needs, then the tower will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as `Starved' water).
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name 
OutdoorAirInletNodeName
```
This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the cooling tower. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air conditions entering the cooling tower are taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an {OutdoorAir:NodeList} object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.
```
	
##  Field: Number of Cells 
NumberOfCells
```
This integer field contains the number of cells in the multi-cell cooling tower. If not entered, the program will assume it is a single-cell cooling tower
```
	
##  Field: Cell Control 
CellControl
```
This alpha field specifies the method used to control the number of cells used to meet the load, the two choices are:
{MinimalCell}: the program will use minimal number of cells needed, all other cells will be shut down with no water flow. It will attempt to use as few cells as possible to cool the fluid. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to exceed its maximum value defined by the {Maximum Water Flow Rate Fraction.}
{MaximalCel} : As many cells as possible will be turned on. In no case, however, will the flow per cell be allowed to drop below its minimum value specified by the {Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction}.
If this field is left blank, the default value is {MaximalCell}.
```
	
##  Field: Cell Minimum Water Flow Rate Fraction 
CellMinimumWaterFlowRateFraction
```
This numeric field specifies the allowable smallest fraction of the design water flow rate. Flows less than this value will commonly result in fluid distribution problems; the pressure at each nozzle will be too weak for the fluid to be sprayed out in the correct pattern, not all the fill would be wet. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.33.
```
	
##  Field: Cell Maximum~ Water Flow Rate Fraction 
CellMaximumWaterFlowRateFraction
```
This numeric field specifies the allowable largest fraction of the design water flow rate. If this field is left blank, the default value is 2.5.
```
	
##  Field: Sizing Factor 
SizingFactor
```
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are:
1.~~~~Design Water Flow Rate;
2.~~~~Design Air Flow Rate;
3.~~~~Design Fan Power.
```
	
##  Field: End-Use Subcategory 
EndUseSubcategory
```
This optional field allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Process''. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref: {Output:Meter} objects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the cooling tower will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

# CoolingTowerPerformanceCoolTools

`CoolingTowerPerformance:CoolTools`
```
Variable speed cooling towers can be modeled by EnergyPlus with user-selectable performance based on the CoolTools correlation, YorkCalc correlation, or user-defined coefficients for either the CoolTools or YorkCalc correlations.The empirical CoolTools tower correlation uses a set of 35 coefficients to model the thermal performance (approach temperature) of a cooling tower based on four independent variables. If the user specifies Model Type = CoolToolsCrossFlow in the {CoolingTower:VariableSpeed} object, then the 35 coefficients derived for the CoolTools simulation model are used and these coefficients are already defined within EnergyPlus. If the user specifies Model Type = CoolToolsUserDefined, then the user must enter a CoolingTowerPerformance:CoolTools object to define the 35 coefficients that will be used by the CoolTools correlation.
The user must specify a name for the model coefficient object, and this name must be used in the {CoolingTower:VariableSpeed} object (field Model Coefficient Name) to tell the program to use these coefficients. Next, the user enters the minimum and maximum values for inlet air wet-bulb temperature, range temperature, approach temperature, and water mass flow rate ratio to specify the valid range for which the model coefficients were derived. For all of these variables, the program issues warnings if the actual values are beyond the minimum/maximum values specified. For inlet air wet-bulb temperature and water mass flow rate ratio, the values of these variables used in the calculation of approach temperature are limited to be within the valid minimum/maximum range specified. For approach and range, the warnings are issued if the values are beyond the specified minimum/maximum range but the actual values are still used.
The CoolTools correlation has four independent variables: inlet air wet-bulb temperature (Twb), tower range temperature (Tr), water flow rate ratio (FRwater), and air flow rate ratio (FRair). Temperatures are in units of °C and flow rate ratios are dimensionless (actual flow rate divided by design flow rate). Using these independent variables, tower approach temperature (°C) is calculated as follows:
Approach = ~~ Coeff(1)~ +~ Coeff(2)?°FRair~ +~ Coeff(3)???(FRair)^{2}~ +
Coeff(4)???(FRair)^{3}~ +~ Coeff(5)?°FRwater~ +
Coeff(6)?°FRair?°FRwater~ +~ Coeff(7)???(FRair)^{2}?°FRwater~ +
Coeff(8)???(FRwater)^{2}~ +~ Coeff(9)?°FRair???(FRwater)^{2}~ +

Coeff(22)?°FRair???Tr~ +~ Coeff(23)?°FRair?°FRair???Tr~ +
Coeff(24)?°FRwater???Tr~ +~ Coeff(25)?°FRair?°FRwater???Tr~ +
Coeff(26)???(FRwater)^{2}???Tr~ +~ Coeff(27)???Twb???Tr~ +

Coeff(33)?°FRwater???(Tr)^{2} +~ Coeff(34)???Twb???(Tr)^{2} +~ Coeff(35)???(Tr)^{3}
This object allows the user to specify model coefficients for use with the CoolTools correlation shown above. It is recommended that a broad set of cooling tower performance data be used to generate these model coefficients. The data set used to create the model coefficients should cover the entire range of water and air flow rate ratios and inlet air wet-bulb, range, and approach temperatures expected during the simulation.

# CoolingTowerPerformanceYorkCalc

`CoolingTowerPerformance:YorkCalc`
```
Variable speed cooling towers can be modeled by EnergyPlus with user-selectable performance based on the CoolTools correlation, YorkCalc correlation, or user-defined coefficients for either the CoolTools or YorkCalc correlations.The empirical YorkCalc tower correlation uses a set of 27 coefficients to model the thermal performance (approach temperature) of a variable speed cooling tower based on three independent variables. If the user specifies Tower Model Type = YorkCalc in the {CoolingTower:VariableSpeed} object, then the 27 coefficients derived for the YorkCalc simulation model are used and these coefficients are already defined within EnergyPlus. If the user specifies Tower Model Type = YorkCalcUserDefined, then the user must enter a CoolingTowerPerformance:YorkCalc object to define the 27 coefficients that will be used by the YorkCalc correlation.
The user must specify a name for the model coefficient object, and this name must be used in the {CoolingTower:VariableSpeed} object (field Model Coefficient Name) to tell the program to use these coefficients. Next, the user enters the minimum and maximum values for inlet air wet-bulb temperature, range temperature, approach temperature, and water mass flow rate ratio to specify the valid range for which the model coefficients were derived. The user also specifies the maximum valid liquid-to-gas ratio. For all of these variables, the program issues warnings if the actual values are beyond the minimum/maximum values specified. For inlet air wet-bulb temperature and water mass flow rate ratio, the values of these variables used in the calculation of approach temperature are limited to be within the valid minimum/maximum range specified. For approach, range, and liquid-to-gas ratio the warnings are issued if the values are beyond the specified minimum/maximum range but the actual values are still used.
The YorkCalc correlation has three independent variables: inlet air wet-bulb temperature (Twb), tower range temperature (Tr), and the liquid-to-gas ratio (ratio of water flow rate ratio to air flow rate ratio = LGRatio). Temperatures are in units of °C and liquid-to-gas ratio is dimensionless. Using these independent variables, an approach temperature (°C) is calculated as follows:
~~~ Approach = ~~~~~ Coeff(1)~ +~ Coeff(2)???Twb~ +~ Coeff(3)???Twb^{2} +~ Coeff(4)???Tr~ +
Coeff(5)???Twb???Tr~ +~ Coeff(6)???Twb^{2}???Tr~ +~ Coeff(7)???Tr^{2}~ +
Coeff(8)???Twb???Tr^{2} +~ Coeff(9)???Twb^{2}???Tr^{2} + Coeff(10)???LGRatio~ +
Coeff(11)???Twb???LGRatio~ +~ Coeff(12)???Twb^{2}???LGRatio~ +
Coeff(13)???Tr???LGRatio~ +~ Coeff(14)???Twb???Tr???LGRatio~ +
Coeff(15)???Twb^{2}???Tr???LGRatio~ +~ Coeff(16)???Tr^{2}???LGRatio~ +
Coeff(17)???Twb???Tr^{2}???LGRatio~ +~ Coeff(18)???Twb^{2}???Tr^{2}???LGRatio +
Coeff(19)???LGRatio^{2} +~ Coeff(20)???Twb???LGRatio^{2}~ +
Coeff(21)??? Twb^{2}???LGRatio^{2} +~ Coeff(22)???Tr???LGRatio^{2} +
Coeff(23)???Twb???Tr???LGRatio^{2} +~ Coeff(24)???Twb^{2}???Tr???LGRatio^{2} +
Coeff(25)???Tr^{2}???LGRatio^{2} +~ Coeff(26)???Twb???Tr^{2}???LGRatio^{2} +
Coeff(27)???Twb^{2}???Tr^{2}???LGRatio^{2}
This object allows the user to specify model coefficients for use with the YorkCalc correlation shown above. It is recommended that a broad set of cooling tower performance data be used to generate these model coefficients. The data set used to create the model coefficients should cover the entire range of water and air flow rate ratios and inlet air wet-bulb, range, and approach temperatures expected during the simulation.

# EvaporativeFluidCoolerSingleSpeed

`EvaporativeFluidCooler:SingleSpeed`
```
Evaporative fluid coolers are components that may be assigned to condenser loops. The Evaporative fluid cooler is modeled as a counter flow heat exchanger with single-speed fans (induced draft configuration). The user must define fluid cooler performance via one of three methods: design heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or standard fluid cooler design capacity at a specific rating point or design capacity at non standard conditions. Regardless of which method is chosen, the design airflow rate and corresponding fan power must be specified.
The evaporative fluid cooler seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the evaporative fluid cooler at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the {CondenserLoop} object. The model first checks to see whether inlet water temperature is at or below the set point. If so, then the fluid cooler fan is not turned on and all the flow goes through bypass. If the inlet water temperature is above the set point then the fluid cooler fan is turned on to reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point. If the capacity control is FanCycling, the model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., fluid cooler fan on for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account. If the capacity control is FluidBypass, the model determines the fraction of water flow to be bypassed while the remaining water goes through the fluid cooler cooling media and gets cooled, then the two water flows mix to meet the setpoint temperature. In this case, the fan runs at full speed for the entire timestep.
Evaporative fluid coolers consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the fluid coolers. For this purpose, the last seven input fields can either be provided in the input or if nothing is specified then the default values for these fields will be used. These fields provide the methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specify connections to the rest of the building's water system by providing the name of a water storage tanks (i.e.~{WaterUse:Storage} objects). The schematic of the system is shown below:
Where,
  h = Enthalpy (j/kg-K)
  m = mass flow rate (kg/s)
  Subscripts
  a = air
  w = water
  wb = wet-bulb
  in = inlet
  out = outlet

##  Field: Design Air Flow Rate 
DesignAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the design air flow rate induced by the fluid cooler fan in m^{3}/s.

See Engineering Reference document for autosizing calculations.
```

DesignAirFlowRateFanPower
```
This numeric field contains the fan power (in watts) at the design air flow rate specified in the previous field. The field must contain a value greater than zero regardless of the fluid cooler performance input method. Alternately, this field can be autosized. See Engineering Reference document for autosizing calculations.
```
	
##  Field: Design Spray Water Flow Rate

```
	
##  Field: Performance Input Method 
PerformanceInputMethod
```
This alpha field contains the method by which the user will specify fluid cooler performance: ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'' or ``StandardDesignCapacity'' or ``UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity''.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name 
OutdoorAirInletNodeName
```
This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the fluid cooler. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air conditions entering the fluid cooler are taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an {OutdoorAir:NodeList} object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Rejection Capacity and Nominal Capacity Sizing Ratio 
HeatRejectionCapacityAndNominalCapacitySizingRatio
```
This numeric field contains the value for the ratio of actual tower heat rejection to nominal capacity.~ This ratio is defined at entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. Historically this ratio has been set at 1.25 based on the assumption that the tower must dissipate 0.25 W of compressor power for every what of heat removed at the chiller evaporator.~ The default is 1.25.
```
	
##  Field: Standard Design Capacity 
StandardDesignCapacity
```
This numeric input field contains the heat rejection capacity of the fluid cooler in watts, with entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.4C (85F), entering air at 25.6C (78F) wetbulb and 35C (95F) drybulb temperatures. The design water flow rate is assumed to be 5.382E-8 m^{3}/s per watt of nominal capacity (3 gpm/ton). 125% of this capacity gives the actual fluid cooler heat rejection at these operating conditions (based on historical assumption that the evaporative fluid cooler must dissipate 0.25W of compressor heat for every watt of heat removed by the evaporator). This field is only used for performance input method = ''StandardDesignCapacity''. For other input methods this field is ignored. The standard conditions mentioned above for ``standard design capacity'' are already specified in the EnergyPlus. So the input fields such as design entering water temp., design entering air wet-bulb and dry-bulb temp. and design water flow rate, if provided in the input, will be ignored for the StandardDesignCapacity performance input method. Also, the standard conditions are for water as a fluid type so this performance input method can only be used with water as a fluid type (ref. {CondenserLoop} object).
```
	
##  Field: Design Air Flow Rate U-factor Times Area Value 
DesignAirFlowRateUFactorTimesAreaValue
```
This numeric field contains the heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) in watts per Kelvin corresponding to the design air and water flow rates specified above. If the input field ``Performance Input Method'' is specified as ``UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate'', then a UA value greater than zero but less than or equal to 300,000 must be defined, or the field can be autosized. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design fluid cooler UA value is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections), the fluid cooler inlet air dry-bulb and wetbulb temperature are taken from the input. This field is only used for performance input method = '' UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate''. For other performance input methods, this field is ignored.
```
	
##  Field: Design Water Flow Rate 
DesignWaterFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the design water flow rate through the fluid cooler in m^{3}/s. This value is the flow rate of the condenser loop water being cooled by the fluid cooler. This field is ignored for the ``StandardDesignCapacity'' performance input method. If autosized, a Plant Sizing object must be defined and the design water flow rate is derived from the design load to be rejected by the condenser loop and the design loop delta T (Ref. Sizing and Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing sections).
```
	
##  Field: User Specified Design Capacity 
UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity
```
This numeric input field contains the heat rejection capacity of the fluid cooler in watts. Design conditions for this capacity i.e.~entering air dry-bulb temperature, entering air wet-bulb temperature and entering water temperature must be provided in the input. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.
```
	
##  Field:Design Entering Water Temperature 
DesignEnteringWaterTemperature
```
This numeric field contains entering water temperature at nominal conditions in degrees Celsius. The design entering water temperature must be greater than the design entering air temperature. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.
```
	
##  Field:Design Entering Air Temperature 
DesignEnteringAirTemperature
```
This numeric field contains entering air dry-bulb temperature at nominal conditions in degrees Celsius. The design entering air temperature must be greater than the design entering air wet-bulb temperature. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.
```
	
##  Field:Design Entering Air Wet-bulb Temperature 
DesignEnteringAirWetBulbTemperature
```
This numeric field contains entering air wetbulb temperature at nominal conditions in degrees Celsius. The design entering air wet-bulb temperature must be less than the design entering air (dry-bulb) temperature. Only used for Performance Input Method = UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity; for other performance input methods this field is ignored.
```
	
##  Field: Capacity Control 
CapacityControl
```
This alpha field contains the cooling capacity control for the evaporative fluid cooler. Two choices are available: FanCycling and FluidBypass. During part-load conditions, there are two ways to maintain the exiting water temperature at the setpoint: either cycling the evaporative fluid cooler fan, or bypassing portion of the evaporative fluid cooler water with a three-way valve. For FluidBypass, the evaporative fluid cooler fan still runs at full speed for the entire timestep, but only portion of the water flow goes through the evaporative fluid cooler media to get cooled while the remaining portion of the water flow gets bypassed. Two water flows then mix at the common water sump to meet the setpoint temperature.
```
	
##  Field: Sizing Factor 
SizingFactor
```
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are:
1.~~ Design Water Flow Rate;
2.~~ Design Air Flow Rate;
3.~~ Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;
4.~~ U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate;
Note that the U-Factor Times Area Value at Design Air Flow Rate is not multiplied by the Sizing Factor. Instead the design evaporative fluid cooler load is multiplied by the sizing factor and the design UA then calculated as usual.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporation Loss Mode 
EvaporationLossMode
```
This field is used to choose which method is used to model the amount of water evaporated by the evaporative fluid cooler. There are two options: LossFactor or SaturatedExit. The default is SaturatedExit. The user-defined loss factor is entered in the following field. By assuming that the air leaving the evaporative fluid cooler is saturated, the evaporation can be directly calculated using moist air engineering calculations with data available within the evaporative fluid cooler model (and does not require additional user input).
```
	
##  Field: Evaporation Loss Factor 
EvaporationLossFactor
```
This field is used to specify the rate of water evaporated from the evaporative fluid cooler and lost to the outside air [percent/K]. This field is only used if the Evaporation Calculation Mode is set to LossFactor. The evaporation loss is then calculated as a fraction of the circulating condenser water flow and varies with the temperature change in the condenser water. The value entered here is in units of percent-per-kelvin. The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water. Empirical correlation is used to calculate default loss factor if it not explicitly specified in the input file.
```
	
##  Field: Drift Loss Percent 
DriftLossPercent
```
This field is used to specify the rate of water lost to the exiting air as entrained droplets [%]. The drift loss is a percent of the condenser water flow. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower's evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.
```
	
##  Field: Blowdown Calculation Mode 
BlowdownCalculationMode
```
This field specifies which method is used to determine blowdown rates. There two options ConcentrationRatio or ScheduledRate. The choice will determine which of the two models below is used. The default is ConcentrationRatio.
```
	
##  Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio 
BlowdownConcentrationRatio
```
This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the evaporative fluid cooler as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the evaporative fluid cooler in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower's evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.
```
	
##  Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name 
BlowdownMakeupWaterUsageScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m3/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the evaporative fluid cooler of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. This schedule is only used if the Blowdown Calculation Mode is set to ScheduledRate. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower's evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the evaporative fluid cooler is active and water is flowing through the evaporative fluid cooler (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).
```
	
##  Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name 
SupplyWaterStorageTankName
```
This field is optional. It is used to describe where the evaporative fluid cooler obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the evaporative fluid cooler will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a {WaterUse:Storage} object is used here, then the evaporative fluid cooler will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the evaporative fluid cooler will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the evaporative fluid cooler needs, then the evaporative fluid cooler will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as `Starved' water).

# EvaporativeFluidCoolerTwoSpeed

`EvaporativeFluidCooler:TwoSpeed`
```
The two-speed evaporative fluid cooler is modeled in a similar fashion to the single-speed evaporative fluid cooler. The evaporative fluid cooler is modeled as a counter flow heat exchanger with two-speed fan (induced draft configuration. See schematic diagram in {Evaporative{FluidCooler:SingleSpeed}} section). The user must define fluid cooler performance via one of the three methods: design heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or standard fluid cooler design capacity at a specific rating point or design capacity at non standard conditions. Regardless of which method is chosen, the design airflow rate and corresponding fan power must be specified.
The evaporative fluid cooler seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the evaporative fluid cooler at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the {CondenserLoop} object. The model first checks to see whether inlet water temperature is at or below the set point. If so, then the fluid cooler fan is not turned on and all the flow goes through bypass. If the inlet water temperature is above the set point then the fluid cooler fan is turned on at low speed to reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point. If operating the fluid cooler fan at low speed does not reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point, then the fluid cooler fan is increased to its high speed.
The model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., fluid cooler fan at high speed for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep, or fluid cooler fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account.
Evaporative fluid coolers consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the evaporative fluid coolers. For this purpose, the last seven input fields can either be provided in the input or if nothing is specified then the default values for these fields will be used. These fields provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specify connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a water storage tanks (i.e.~{WaterUse:Storage} objects).

This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

Instead the design evaporative fluid cooler load is multiplied by the sizing factor and the design UA then calculated as usual. The U-Factor Times Area Value at Low Fan Speed is set to Low Fan Speed U-Factor Times Area Sizing Factor times the full load design UA.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporation Loss Mode

```
This field is used to choose which method is used to model the amount of water evaporated by the evaporative fluid cooler. There are two options: LossFactor or SaturatedExit. The default is SaturatedExit. The user-defined loss factor is entered in the following field.

```
	
##  Field: Evaporation Loss Factor 
EvaporationLossFactor
```
This field is used to specify the rate of water evaporated from the evaporative fluid cooler and lost to the outside air [percent/K].

The value entered here is in units of percent-per-kelvin. The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water. Empirical correlation is used to calculate default loss factor if it not explicitly specified in the input file.

##  Field: Drift Loss Percent

```
This field is used to specify the rate of water lost to the exiting air as entrained droplets [%]. The drift loss is a percent of the condenser water flow. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower's evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.

```
	
##  Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio 
BlowdownConcentrationRatio
```
This field is used to dynamically adjust the rate of blowdown in the evaporative fluid cooler as a function of the rate of evaporation. Blowdown is water intentionally drained from the evaporative fluid cooler in order to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation. The value entered here is dimensionless. It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower's evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.
```
	
##  Field: Blowdown Makeup Water Usage Schedule Name 
BlowdownMakeupWaterUsageScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the schedule used to define the amount of water (m3/s) flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the evaporative fluid cooler of mineral scale build-up and other contaminants. This schedule is only used if the Blowdown Calculation Mode is set to ScheduledRate. The amount of water use due to blowdown depends on the makeup water quality and is specific to each geographical location. Default value is under investigation for now cooling tower's evaporation loss factor is taken as default value.This water usage is in addition to the amount of water lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation and/or drift. Since blowdown occurs when the basin water contaminant concentration is high, blowdown only occurs when the evaporative fluid cooler is active and water is flowing through the evaporative fluid cooler (regardless of the water usage defined by this schedule).
```
	
##  Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name 
SupplyWaterStorageTankName
```
This field is optional. It is used to describe where the evaporative fluid cooler obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the evaporative fluid cooler will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a {WaterUse:Storage} object is used here, then the evaporative fluid cooler will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the evaporative fluid cooler will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the evaporative fluid cooler needs, then the evaporative fluid cooler will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as `Starved' water).

Fluid coolers are components that may be assigned to condenser loops. The Fluid cooler is modeled as a cross flow heat exchanger (both streams unmixed) with single-speed fans (induced draft configuration). The user must define fluid cooler performance via one of the two methods: design heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or nominal fluid cooler capacity at a specific rating point. Regardless of which method is chosen, the design airflow rate and corresponding fan power must be specified.
The fluid cooler seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the fluid cooler at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the {CondenserLoop} object.

# FluidCoolerTwoSpeed

`FluidCooler:TwoSpeed`
```
The two-speed fluid cooler is modeled in a similar fashion to the single-speed fluid cooler. The fluid cooler is modeled as a cross flow heat exchanger (both stream unmixed) with~ two-speed fans (induced draft configuration). The user must define fluid cooler performance via one of two methods: heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or nominal fluid cooler capacity at a specific rating point. Regardless of which method is chosen, the airflow rate and corresponding fan power at both high and low fan speed must be specified. The Fluid Cooler seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the Fluid Cooler at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the {CondenserLoop} object. The model first runs at low speed and calculates the fluid cooler exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on ``low speed'' is at or below the set point, then the fluid cooler fan runs at this speed or below this speed. If the exiting water temperature remains above the set point after ``low speed'' is modeled, then the fluid cooler fan runs at high speed to reduce the exiting water temperature.
The model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., fluid cooler fan at high speed for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep,). Cyclic losses are not taken into account.

# GroundHeatExchangerSystem

`GroundHeatExchanger:System`
```
The EnergyPlus ground loop heat exchanger is a condenser component which serves the condenser supply side in addition to the cooling towers and other condensing components. Figure {fig:schematic-of-energyplus-ground-loop-heat} shows the Ground Heat Exchanger in the simulation environment.
The heat exchanger response is defined by a g-function which is a non-dimensional function that is used to calculate the response to square heat pulses of different duration. (This function is not the same as `G-factors' referred to in the ASHRAE Applications Handbook). This continuous function is specified by a series of data pairs (LNTTS{i}, GFNC{i}) where,
  LNTTS{i} is the non-dimensional time: {ln(T/T_{s})}
  GFNC{i} is the g-function value
The g-function is different for each borehole field configuration (i.e.~a 4 X 4 field has a different response than a 80 X 80 field). It is also dependent on the ratio of borehole spacing to depth. g-function values, for accurate simulation, have to be computed for each specific heat exchanger design. The GroundHeatExchanger:System object will accept three different types of input in order to define the g-functions necessary for the ground heat exchanger calculations.
     Use the {GroundHeatExchanger:Vertical:Array} object to define a rectangular borehole field. EnergyPlus will compute and cache the g-functions for reuse again in future simulations.
     Use one or more {GroundHeatExchanger:Vertical:Single} objects to define a vertical borehole field with the boreholes located arbitrarily. EnergyPlus will compute and cache the g-functions for reuse again in future simulations.
     Use a third-party tool, such as GLHEPro, to compute the g-functions and pass them to EnergyPlus using the {GroundHeatExchanger:ResponseFactors} object.
A small number of reference datasets containing example input data for 1 X 2, 4 X 4 and 8 X 8 configurations and for both standard and thermally enhanced grout are provided as well.
Definitions for the input fields are provided below.

```
	
##  Field: G-Function Reference Ratio 
GFunctionReferenceRatio
```
The G-Functions may be formulated slightly differently based on the program which generated them. The original g-functions as defined by Eskilson are based on an borehole radius to active length ratio of 0.0005. If the physical ratio is different from this, a correction must be applied. EnergyPlus will apply the correction, based on the reference ratio entered in this field. Therefore, therefore two possible input configurations.
  If the g-functions have not had a correction applied, then the g-functions are still based on a reference of 0.0005, so use a value of 0.0005 in this field. EnergyPlus will adjust the g-functions internally to create the properly referenced g-function.
  If the correction has already been applied, then the input g-functions are based on a reference to the actual (physical) radius/length ratio, so enter the physical radius/length in this field. Entering the actual value will nullify any internal corrections, which will avoid re-basing the g-function set.
The software GLHEPro has been making this ``pre-correction'' to the data sets since version 3.1 of that software, so this input field should match the actual (physical) radius/length ratio.
```

# GroundHeatExchangerSlinky

`GroundHeatExchanger:Slinky`
```
The GroundHeatExchanger:Slinky use the g-functions to calculate the GHX temperature response, similar to the GroundHeatExchanger:Vertical model, however for this model g-functions are automatically calculated by EnergyPlus without the need of external software or data.
Horizontal slinky-loop ground heat exchangers (GHXs) consist of coiled tubing, with the individual rings spread out along the direction of the trench either horizontally or vertically, as shown in {SlinkyIOFig1}{Figure}. A schematic of a slinky GHX can be seen in {SlinkyIOFig2}{Figure}. Compared to conventional straight tube horizontal GHXs, slinky loops have a higher tube density; hence, with the same cooling/heating loads, slinky-loop GHXs require less land area and excavation work than straight tube HGHXs.

# HeatExchangerFluidToFluid

`HeatExchanger:FluidToFluid`
```
A fluid-to-fluid heat exchanger designed to couple the supply side of one plant or condenser loop to the demand side of another plant or condenser loop.
This heat exchanger is fairly general and can be configured for use in any application where any two loops need to be connected together.
The only constraints are that that one side must be connected to the supply side of one loop and the other side connected to the demand side of a different loop.
Because the heat exchanger is intended to be generic, its two sides are distinguished by the nature of loop side being connected.
One side is called {Loop Supply Side} to indicate the heat exchanger is situated on the supply side of a loop.
The other side is called {Loop Demand Side} to indicate it is on the demand side of a loop.
The heat exchanger is intended to act as a supply component for the loop connected to it as the ``Loop Supply Side''
and as a demand component for the loop connected to it as the ``Loop Demand Side.''
From the point of view of the heat exchanger model itself, the Loop Demand Side fluid serves as the source/sink to supply heating/cooling to the fluid in the Loop Supply Side.
This heat exchanger can be used for a wide variety of applications including chilled water, hot water, condenser, ground source, primary-secondary systems, etc.
Heat transfer is calculated and reported using a sign convention from chilled water applications
where {positive heat transfer indicates energy was extracted from the Loop Supply Side and added to the Loop Demand Side.}
{Note}: Only hydronic ``plant'' fluids are allowed (excepting Fluid Type Steam), no air-side connections are possible with this heat exchanger.
{Various options are available for the heat exchanger model.}
    The heat transfer between the two sides can be modeled using one of seven different models for different types of heat exchangers.
    There are also eleven options for different ways to control the heat exchanger.
    
        
            One general type of control is {OnOff} where the flow through the heat exchanger is either fully on or fully off.
        
            Another type of control is {Modulated} where the flow through the Loop Demand Side is controlled to try and meet a target setpoint or load on the Loop Supply Side.
    
As of Version 8.0, {this object replaces three separate objects that were available prior to version 8.0 of EnergyPlus}.
    The former {HeatExchanger:Hydronic} object corresponds to a situation where the Loop Demand Side is the demand side of condenser loop,
    the Loop Supply Side is a the supply side of a chilled water loop, the control type is ``CoolingSetpointOnOffWithComponentOverride'',
    and the remote override component is a chiller.
    The former {HeatExchanger:WatersideEconomizer} object corresponds to a situation where the Loop Demand Side is the demand side of condenser loop,
    the Loop Supply Side is a the supply side of a chilled water loop, and the control type is ``CoolingDifferentialOnOff.''
    The former {HeatExchanger:Plate} object corresponds to a situation where the Loop Demand Side is the demand side of a condenser loop,
    the Loop Supply Side is the supply side of a second condenser loop, and the control type is ``UncontrolledOn.''

```
	
##  Field: Control Type 
ControlType
```
This field is used to specify how the heat exchanger is to be controlled during operation.~ Different applications for connecting two loops will require different control behavior and different control options are needed depending on the desired behavior.~ There are the following eleven key choice options to choose from:
  {UncontrolledOn}. This control mode is applicable to situations where the heat exchanger is passively running all the time and always transfers as much heat as possible between the fluid streams.~ However there is one aspect of control in that it will only request flow on the Loop Demand Side when there is non-zero flow into the heat exchanger on the Loop Supply Side.~ This control mode corresponds to that available in the HeatExchanger:Plate object prior to version 8.0.
  {OperationSchemeModulated}.~ This control mode is applicable to situations where the heat exchanger is controlled by an operation scheme (see objects called PlantEquipmentOperationScheme or {CondenserEquipmentOperationSchemes}).~ When using this control mode the heat exchanger must be listed in {PlantEquipmentList} or a {CondenserEquipmentList} and it serves as a supply component.~ The operation scheme will dispatch a load request to the heat exchanger which it will try meet by conditioning the fluid stream connected as the Loop Supply Side.~ If the heat exchanger could exceed the load request, then the flow through the fluid stream connected as the Loop Demand Side will be modulated to just meet the load request.
  {OperationSchemeOnOff}. This control mode is applicable to situations where the heat exchanger is controlled by an operation scheme (see objects called PlantEquipmentOperationScheme or {CondenserEquipmentOperationSchemes}).~ When using this control mode the heat exchanger must be listed in {PlantEquipmentList} or a {CondenserEquipmentList} and it serves as a supply component.~ The operation scheme will dispatch a load request to the heat exchanger which it will use as an on/off signal to decide if the heat exchange should run or not.~ If it runs, it will run at full capacity and may exceed the load request.
  {HeatingSetpointModulated}.~ This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide useful heating to the Loop Supply Side.~ A heating setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.~ If the setpoint and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Demand Side to the Loop Supply Side to meet the heating setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run.~ The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate. ~If the heat exchanger could overshoot the setpoint, then the flow through the fluid stream connected as the Loop Demand Side will be modulated to just meet the setpoint.
  {HeatingSetpointOnOff}. This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide useful heating to the Loop Supply Side.~ A heating setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.~ If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Demand Side to the Loop Supply Side to meet the heating setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run. The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate. ~If it runs, it will run at full capacity and may overshoot the setpoint.
  {CoolingSetpointModulated}.~ This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide useful cooling to the Loop Supply Side.~ A cooling setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.~ If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Supply Side to the Loop Demand Side to meet the cooling setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run. The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate. If the heat exchanger could undershoot the setpoint, then the flow through the fluid stream connected as the Loop Demand Side will be modulated to just meet the setpoint.
  {CoolingSetpointOnOff}. This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide useful cooling to the Loop Supply Side.~ A cooling setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.~ If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Supply Side to the Loop Demand Side to meet the cooling setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run. The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate. If it runs, it will run at full capacity and may undershoot the setpoint.~ This control mode corresponds to that available in the HeatExchanger:WatersideEconomizer object prior to version 8.0.
  {DualDeadbandSetpointModulated}. This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide either useful cooling or heating to the Loop Supply Side.~ A dual deadband setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.~ If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Demand Side to the Loop Supply Side to meet the lower setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run. If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Supply Side to the Loop Demand Side to meet the high setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run. The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate.~ If the heat exchanger could overshoot the lower setpoint, or undershoot the higher setpoint, then the flow through the fluid stream connected as the Loop Demand Side will be modulated to just meet the deadband setpoint.
  {DualDeadbandSetpointOnOff}. This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide either useful cooling or heating to the Loop Supply Side.~ A dual deadband setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.~ If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Demand Side to the Loop Supply Side to meet the lower setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run. If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Supply Side to the Loop Demand Side to meet the high setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run. The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate. If the heat exchanger runs, it will run at full capacity and may overshoot the lower setpoint or undershoot the higher setpoint.
  {CoolingDifferentialOnOff}.~ This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide useful cooling to the Loop Supply Side.~ This mode is similar to CoolingSetpointOnOff except that it ignores any cooling setpoint and its control is based only on the temperature difference between Loop Demand Side and the Loop Supply Side.~ The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate.~ ~This control mode corresponds to that available in the HeatExchanger:WatersideEconomizer object prior to version 8.0.
  {CoolingSetpointOnOffWithComponentOverride}.  This control mode is applicable to situations where the heat exchanger operation is integrated with the operation of a specific chiller.  Typically the heat exchanger and chiller are in parallel on separate branches.  When conditions are favorable for the heat exchanger to provide cooling to the Loop Supply Side, the heat exchanger is run and the integrated chiller is turned off.  When conditions are not favorable, the heat exchanger is competely off and the chiller is allowed to run as usual.  A cooling setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.  If it runs it will run at full capacity and may undershoot the setpoint.  The chiller that is integrated with the heat exchanger is identified by entering the names of the chiller's inlet nodes in the input fields below.~ The control decision can be based on one of three different temperature signals selected in the field below called Component Override Cooling Control Temperature Mode.~ The setpoint and control signal temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate. This control mode corresponds to that available in the HeatExchanger:Hydronic object prior to version 8.0.

If the previous field is set to DualDeadbandSetpointModulated or DeadbandSetpointOnOff then there must be a setpoint manager that places both a high and low setpoint on the node named in this field. (see {SetpointManager:Scheduled:DualSetpoint}).

```
	
##  Field: Heat Transfer Metering End Use Type 
HeatTransferMeteringEndUseType
```
This field specifies how the metering for heat transfer will be accounted with respect to end uses.~ Although the heat exchanger consumes no energy that needs to be metered, there are also meters for heat transfers that apply to the model. The nature of the end use may vary depending on the application that the heat exchanger is being used for.~ The available choices are FreeCooling, HeatRecovery, HeatRejection, HeatRecoveryForCooling, HeatRecoveryForHeating, and LoopToLoop.

```
	
##  Field: Component Override Cooling Control Temperature Mode 
ComponentOverrideCoolingControlTemperatureMode
```
This field specifies which type of temperature is used to control a heat exchanger that uses the control type called CoolingSetpointOnOffWithComponentOverride.~ There are three options: Loop, WetBulbTemperature, and DryBulbTemperature.~ The option called ``Loop'' directs the program to use the inlet fluid temperature at the Loop Demand Side connection of~ heat exchanger for the temperature used as a signal to be compared with the setpoint. The option call ``WetBulbTemperature'' uses the outdoor air wetbulb temperature as the signal.~ The option called ``DryBulbTemperature'' uses the outdoor air drybulb temperature as the signal.
```
	
##  Field: Sizing Factor 
SizingFactor
```
This optional field can be used to modify the results of autosize calculations.~ This sizing factor is used for this heat exchanger and modifies sizing results by multiplying them by the factor entered here.~ This factor is applied to the Loop Supply Side Design Flow rate and in turn affects the heat exchanger UA and the loop demand side flow rate which are derived from that flow rate.~ This allows fine control over the size of the heat exchanger when using autosize in those fields.

# ControlsAirLoopAndZoneEquipment

`Controls (Air Loop and Zone Equipment)`
```
A controller mimics the function of an actual physical controller in a somewhat rudimentary way. It can sense one node variable, compare it with its setpoint, and determine the desired value for another node variable. It should be noted that a controller cannot span a loop manager boundary (but a Setpoint Manager can). Thus, in an air loop ({AirLoopHVAC}), the sensed node and the controlled device must be in the air loop simulation. This means that a single zone system cannot be modeled with a simple controller sensing zone temperature and controlling coil water flow. Instead this must be modeled as a Setpoint Manager sensing a zone temperature and resetting the supply air temperature setpoint each timestep. This is artificial but should simplify the control modeling task. It should also be noted that there are various types of controllers and that each controller might hook into loops in a slightly different way. As a result, each controller type is described separately below.
```

# ControllerWaterCoil

`Controller:WaterCoil`
```
This controller is really a solution inverter. For a water coil the simulation cannot be inverted where the mass flow rate of the water through the coil can be solved directly given an air temperature. Thus, this controller will numerically step through all of the water flow possibilities by an interval-halving technique until the mass flow rate is determined to meet the specified outlet air temperature within a specified user tolerance.
As the reader probably noted when reading the descriptions of the coil syntax shown earlier in this section, there were no controls attached directly to a particular component. This is because the input can be simplified somewhat by entering node names to be controlled. This avoids having to search through multiple lists of component types for the sake of simply controlling components. The Controller:WaterCoil shown below is a way of controlling variables at one node based on conditions at another node. After the identifying name for the controller, the user must define which control variable the controller is managing. These options include Temperature, Humidity Ratio, TemperatureAndHumidityRatio, or Flow.
The next parameter in the input syntax is the Action of the control, which determines how the controlled variable (e.g., mass flow rate through a water coil) is changed based on the control signal. The following input parameter is the actuator variable, which is currently limited to mass flow through a water coil.
The next two parameters in the input syntax are node names corresponding to the node that is being sensed and the actuated node which controls the water mass flow through the coil. For example, in the case of a cooling coil the control variable might be the outlet air temperature of the coil while the actuated variable might be the water flow rate through the coil. These two parameters are followed by the controller convergence tolerance. Finally, the last two input parameters represent the maximum and minimum values allowed for the actuated variable at the actuated node.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This is the unique name of the controller.
```
	
##  Field: Control Variable 
ControlVariable
```
This was setup to be generic but to date has only been used for temperature control, or temperature and humidity ratio control, of a water coil in the air loop simulation. The keyword Temperature is used for air temperature control and is normally specified for the coils outlet air node. The keyword TemperatureAndHumidityRatio is used for controlling both air temperature and high humidity levels, and is normally specified for a cooling coils outlet air node. The keyword HumidityRatio is used for humidity control and would normally be specified for a dehumidifier outlet node. These two keywords require a {ZoneControl:Humidistat} object and a maximum humidity setpoint manager object (SetPointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum, SetPointManager:MultiZone:MaximumHumidity:Average or SetPointManager:MultiZone:Humidity:Maximum). If the coil is located in the outdoor air stream, it may also be necessary to use {SetpointManager:OutdoorAirPretreat}.
```
	
##  Field: Action 
Action
```
The next input refers to the action of the control. This can be best described by an example. In a coil where water mass flow rate is to be controlled, a coil will increase the mass flow rate through the coil when more heating or cooling is requested. In a heating coil, this increases the value of heat transfer from the water to the air stream. As a result, this is considered a Normal action controller. In a cooling coil, an increase in water mass flow rate through the coil decreases the value of heat transfer from the water to the air stream (absolute value increases, but since cooling is traditionally described as a negative number, an increase in absolute value results in a decrease in the actual heat transfer value). Thus, the cooling coil controller has Reverse action since an increase in flow rate results in a decrease in heat transfer.
```
	
##  Field: Actuator Variable 
ActuatorVariable
```
This was again meant to be more generic but currently has only been used to control the water mass flow rate of a heating or cooling coil. This actuator variable must be set to the keyword Flow to control the water mass flow rate.
```
	
##  Field: Sensor Node Name 
SensorNodeName
```
Name of the node where the temperature, humidity ratio or flow is sensed.
```
	
##  Field: Actuator Node Name 
ActuatorNodeName
```
Name of the actuated node that controls the water mass flow rate through the coil.
```
	
##  Field: Controller Convergence Tolerance 
ControllerConvergenceTolerance
```
The coil is controlled by knowing the outlet temperature and/or humidity ratio specified by the setpoint managers, and setting the outlet conditions from the coil to meet these setpoints. The hot and chilled water coils use complex models that cannot be inverted directly. Therefore, to determine the correct mass flow rate for the hot or cold water the models are inverted numerically using an iterative procedure. The iterative solution uses an interval-halving routine and needs a termination criterion that is set with the Controller Convergence Tolerance parameter. The convergence tolerance is the maximum difference between the actual temperature at the setpoint node and the setpoint temperature. This control offset is set to a small temperature difference, such as 0.01 to denote 1/100 degree C. The default is 0.1 degree C.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Actuated Flow 
MaximumActuatedFlow
```
This is the maximum water flow (m^{3}/sec) through the coil. Set to the maximum design water flow for the coil.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Actuated Flow 
MinimumActuatedFlow
```
Set to the minimum design water flow (m^{3}/sec) for the water coil, normally a shut off valve that is set to zero.
An example of this object in an IDF, along with appropriate setpoint managers, is shown below:

# ControllerOutdoorAir

`Controller:OutdoorAir`
```
A mixed air box has its own controller type called Controller:OutdoorAir. The purpose of the outdoor air controller is to provide outdoor air for ventilation and also provide free cooling (through additional outdoor air and/or bypassing an air-to-air heat exchanger) whenever possible. The outdoor air controller includes a number of user-selectable limit controls. If any of the selected limits are exceeded, the outdoor airflow rate is set to the minimum.
If all the limits are satisfied, the outdoor air controller does the following for continuous air flow systems: if the outdoor air temperature is greater than or equal to the mixed air temperature setpoint, the outdoor air flow rate is set to the maximum; if the outdoor air temperature is less than the mixed air temperature setpoint, the outdoor air controller will modulate the outdoor air flow so that the mixed air temperature will match the mixed air setpoint temperature.
A time-of-day schedule may also be used to simulate an increase in outdoor air flow rate for push-button type economizer applications. When the schedule permits (i.e., schedule values are greater than 0), the outdoor air flow rate is increased to the user-specified maximum outdoor air flow rate.
The outdoor air controller can also account for changes in the outdoor air flow rate during times when indoor humidity levels are high. A zone humidistat must be used with this control option. During high indoor humidity, the outdoor air flow rate is modified in response to a high indoor humidity condition. If high humidity control is based on the outdoor air humidity ratio and the outdoor humidity ratio is greater than the indoor humidity ratio, high humidity control is terminated. When the economizer is used in conjunction with the high humidity control option, high humidity control has priority and controls the change in air flow rates. The Night Ventilation Availability Manager has priority over high humidity control and will use the controllers maximum outdoor air flow rate when this Availability Manager cycles the fan on (Ref. System Availability Managers {AvailabilityManager:NightVentilation})
The mixed air box connections are defined separately in the {{OutdoorAir:Mixer}} object.
Although the mixer will commonly be connected directly to the outdoor air, other components may be placed on the outdoor air path upstream of the mixer. When this is the case, any modulation will be determined by the conditions at the inlet node of the mixer rather than the outdoor air. This means that the controller will account for any heat recovery or other preheating/precooling components that may modify the condition of outdoor air before it reaches the mixer.
If all the limits are satisfied, the outdoor air controller does the following for cycling fan systems: the outdoor air flow rate is set to the maximum when the fan cycles on. If the limits are not satisfied, the outdoor air flow rate is at the minimum when the fan cycles on.
There are various minimum and maximum limits on the outdoor air flow rate which are applied in the following order. Limits that fall later in the list can override earlier limits.
  OA flow rate = Minimum Outdoor Air Flow Rate * Minimum Outdoor Air Schedule
  Apply economizer controls
  OA flow rate \ge {Controller:MechanicalVentilation} OA flow rate
  OA flow rate \ge System exhaust flow rate
  (OA flow rate)/(Current mixed air flow rate) \ge Minimum Fraction of Outdoor Air Schedule
  (OA flow rate)/(Current mixed air flow rate) \le Maximum Fraction of Outdoor Air Schedule (even if this reduces the OA flow rate, can override all minimums and economizer)
  OA flow rate \le Maximum Outdoor Air Flow Rate
  Apply OA flow rate specified by demand limiting
  Apply OA flow rate specified by EMS
  OA flow rate \le Current mixed air flow rate (system flow rate)

{FixedEnthalpy} checks the upper limit of the enthalpy given as a field input against the enthalpy content of outdoor air and will set the outdoor airflow rate to minimum if the latter is greater than the former.
{DifferentialEnthalpy} does the same thing but compares the return air enthalpy with the enthalpy of outdoor air. When the enthalpy of outdoor air is greater than the enthalpy of the return air, the outdoor air flow rate is set to minimum.
Choosing {ElectronicEnthalpy} enables the simulation to calculate the humidity ratio limit of outdoor air based on the dry-bulb temperature of outdoor air and a quadratic/cubic curve, and compare it to the actual outdoor air humidity ratio. If the actual outdoor humidity ratio is greater than the calculated humidity ratio limit, then the outdoor airflow rate is set to minimum.
Choosing {FixedDewPointAndDryBulb} compares both the outdoor dewpoint temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature to their specified high limit values. If either outdoor temperature exceeds the high limit value, the outdoor airflow rate is set to minimum.
Another option {DifferentialDryBulbAndEnthalpy} enables the control strategy to be based on both the DifferentialDryBulb and DifferentialEnthalpy economizer control strategies.
In addition to all economizer control types listed above, each control type checks for user-entered values for the upper limit of dry-bulb temperature, enthalpy limit, humidity ratio limit and dewpoint limit. The outdoor air flow rate is set to minimum if any of these entered limits are exceeded.
The default for this field is {NoEconomizer}.
```
	
##  Field: Economizer Control Action Type 
EconomizerControlActionType
```
There are two choices for this Field: {MinimumFlowWithBypass} and {ModulateFlow}, with the default being {ModulateFlow} if this input field is left blank.
{ModulateFlow} means the outdoor air flow rate will be increased to meet the mixed air setpoint temperature, subject to the limits imposed via other inputs for this object (e.g., Economizer Maximum Limit Dry-Bulb Temperature, Maximum Outdoor Air Flow Rate, etc.).
{MinimumFlowWithBypass} is used exclusively in conjunction with air-to-air heat exchanger:objects (Ref. HeatExchanger:*) for providing free cooling operation in the absence of a conventional air-side economizer (i.e., when outdoor air flow rate is not increased during economizer mode). The MinimumFlowWithBypass choice forces the outdoor air flow rate to always remain at the minimum. However, when high humidity control is used, the outdoor air flow rate is set to the product of the maximum outdoor air flow rate multiplied by the high humidity outdoor air flow ratio. The heat exchanger uses the limit checking in the outdoor air controller to decide whether or not to bypass the outdoor air around the heat exchanger or turn off the wheel motor in the case of a rotary heat exchanger. Heat exchange is also suspended when high humidity control is active.
The {ModulateFlow} option can also be used with the {HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate} or {HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent} objects.
```
	
##  Field: Economizer Maximum Limit Dry-Bulb Temperature 
EconomizerMaximumLimitDryBulbTemperature
```
Input for this field is the outdoor air temperature high limit ( °C) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air temperature is above this limit, the outdoor airflow rate will be set to the minimum. This field is required if Economizer Control Type FixedDryBulb or FixedDewPointAndDryBulb has been specified.
No input (blank) in this field means that there is no outdoor air temperature high limit control. This limit applies to the conditions at the Actuator Node regardless of whether or not there are any other components in the outdoor air path upstream of the mixer. If non-blank, this limit is applied regardless of the specified Economizer Control Type.
```
	
##  Field: Economizer Maximum Limit Enthalpy 
EconomizerMaximumLimitEnthalpy
```
Input for this field is the outdoor air enthalpy limit (in J/kg) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air enthalpy is above this value, the outdoor airflow rate will be set to the minimum. This field is required if Economizer Control Type FixedEnthalpy has been specified.
No input (blank) in this field means that there is no outdoor air enthalpy limit control. This limit applies to the conditions at the Actuator Node regardless of whether or not there are any other components in the outdoor air path upstream of the mixer. If non-blank, this limit is applied regardless of the specified Economizer Control Type.
```
	
##  Field: Economizer Maximum Limit Dewpoint Temperature 
EconomizerMaximumLimitDewpointTemperature
```
Input for this field is the outdoor air dewpoint limit (°C) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air dewpoint temperature is above this value, the outdoor airflow rate will be set to the minimum. This field is required if the Economizer Control Type FixedDewPointAndDryBulb has been specified.
No input (blank) in this field means that there is no outdoor air dewpoint limit control. This limit applies to the conditions at the Actuator Node regardless of whether or not there are any other components in the outdoor air path upstream of the mixer. If non-blank, this limit is applied regardless of the specified Economizer Control Type.
```
	
##  Field: Electronic Enthalpy Limit Curve Name 
ElectronicEnthalpyLimitCurveName
```
Input for this field is the name of a quadratic or cubic curve which provides the maximum outdoor air humidity ratio (function of outdoor air dry-bulb temperature) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air humidity ratio is greater than the curve's maximum humidity ratio (evaluated at the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature), the outdoor air flow rate will be set to the minimum. This limit applies to the conditions at the Actuator Node regardless of whether or not there are any other components in the outdoor air path upstream of the mixer. No input (blank) in this field means that there is no electronic enthalpy limit control. If non-blank, this limit is applied regardless of the specified Economizer Control Type.
```
	
##  Field: Economizer Minimum Limit Dry-Bulb Temperature 
EconomizerMinimumLimitDryBulbTemperature
```
Input for this field is the outdoor air temperature low limit ( °C) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air temperature is below this limit, the outdoor airflow rate will be set to the minimum.
No input (blank) in this field means that there is no outdoor air temperature low limit control. This limit applies to the conditions at the Actuator Node regardless of whether or not there are any other components in the outdoor air path upstream of the mixer. If non-blank, this limit is applied regardless of the specified Economizer Control Type.
```
	
##  Field: Lockout Type 
LockoutType
```
Choices for this field are NoLockout, LockoutWithHeating, and LockoutWithCompressor. This field is used for packaged systems with DX coils. LockoutWithHeating means that if the packaged unit is in heating mode, the economizer is locked out i.e., the economizer dampers are closed and there is minimum outdoor air flow. LockoutWithCompressor means that in addition to locking out the economizer when the unit is in heating mode the economizer is locked out when the DX unit compressor is operating to provide cooling. In other words, the economizer must meet the entire cooling load; it is not allowed to operate in conjunction with the DX cooling coil. This option (LockoutWithCompressor) is sometimes called a nonintegrated economizer.
When LockoutWithHeating or LockoutWithCompressor is selected, the lockout may also be applied to non-packaged systems for heating. If any air loop heating coil is operating, the lockout control compares the mixed air temperature at minimum outdoor air flow without heat recovery (if any) to the mixed air temperature set point. If the mixed air temperature at minimum outdoor air flow is less than the mixed air temperature set point, then the economizer is locked out and the outdoor air flow rate is set to the minimum. When the economizer is locked out, the heat recovery bypass control will be set to activate heat recovery (no bypass), if present. This action is meant to minimize heating energy (this action may also disable the heating coil on subsequent iterations, see output variable Air System Outdoor Air Heat Recovery Bypass Heating Coil Activity Status).
The default is NoLockout.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Limit Type 
MinimumLimitType
```
Choices for this field are FixedMinimum or ProportionalMinimum. FixedMinimum means that the minimum outdoor airflow rate is fixed no matter what the actual system flow rate is. ProportionalMinimum means the minimum outdoor airflow rate varies in proportion to the total system air flow rate. The default is ProportionalMinimum.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Outdoor Air Schedule Name 
MinimumOutdoorAirScheduleName
```
The name of a schedule which uses decimal values (e.g., 0.0 or 1.0). These values are multiplied by the minimum outdoor air flow rate. This schedule is useful for reducing the outdoor air flow rate to zero during unoccupied or start up hours. If this field is not entered, the minimum outdoor air flow rate either remains constant during the simulation period (Minimum Outdoor Air Control Type = FixedMinimum) or varies in proportion to the supply air flow rate (Minimum Outdoor Air Control Type = ProportionalMinimum).
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Fraction of Outdoor Air Schedule Name 
MinimumFractionOfOutdoorAirScheduleName
```
The name of a schedule with decimal values which are limited between 0.0 and 1.0. The current schedule value is multiplied by the current system mixed air flow rate to set the minimum outdoor air flow rate. If this schedule name is blank, then it is not applied.
If this schedule is 1.0 (and there is no Maximum Fraction of Outdoor Air Schedule Name), then the system works at 100% outdoor air regardless of any other condition as long as the Maximum Outdoor Air Flow Rate is \ge the system supply air flow rate.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Fraction of Outdoor Air Schedule Name 
MaximumFractionOfOutdoorAirScheduleName
```
The name of a schedule with decimal values which are limited between 0.0 and 1.0. The current schedule value is multiplied by the current system mixed air flow rate to set the maximum outdoor air flow rate. This schedule is applied after all other limits (except EMS and demand-limiting overrides).  This schedule can override all minimums and economizer operations.  For example, if this schedule is zero, then the outdoor air flow rate will be zero, regardless of any other settings in Controller:OutdoorAir or {Controller:MechanicalVentilation}. If this schedule name is blank, then it is not applied.
```
	
##  Field: Mechanical Ventilation Controller Name 
MechanicalVentilationControllerName
```
This optional field is the name of the mechanical ventilation controller object to be used in conjunction with this outdoor air controller. The {Controller:MechanicalVentilation} object allows the user to define the minimum outdoor air flow rate based on air flow per unit floor area and air flow per person (occupant) for the zones being served by the air loop that utilizes this controller.
This feature allows the user to perform a first-order evaluation of carbon dioxide(CO_{2})-based demand controlled ventilation (outdoor ventilation varied according to occupancy levels).
If a valid name for a {Controller:MechanicalVentilation} object is entered in this field, the minimum outdoor air flow rate delivered will be the greater of:
  the minimum outdoor air flow rate calculated by the fields Minimum Outdoor Air Flow Rate, Minimum Limit Type, and Minimum Outdoor Air Schedule Name as defined for this outdoor air controller, or
  the outdoor air flow rate calculated using the {Controller:MechanicalVentilation} object named in this input field.
Leaving this input field blank will bypass the {Controller:MechanicalVentilation} object calculations and the minimum outdoor air flow rate will be based on the other inputs associated with this outdoor air controller object. Actual outdoor air flow rates may be higher than the minimum if free cooling is available and the object inputs are properly selected. Regardless, the maximum outdoor air flow rate is limited by the field Maximum Outdoor Air Flow Rate.
Note that the Minimum Outdoor Air Flow Rate times the Minimum Outdoor Air Schedule is a hard minimum that may override DCV or other advanced outdoor air controls specified in the {Controller:MechanicalVentilation} object.  A recursive warning is provided for users in the error file, when the override occurs at a specific time. The Maximum Fraction of Outdoor Air Schedule (if specified) times the current system supply air flow rate may limit the outdoor air flow rate set by the {Controller:MechanicalVentilation}.
```
	
##  Field: Time of Day Economizer Control Schedule Name 
TimeOfDayEconomizerControlScheduleName
```
This alpha field is the name of a schedule which controls the outdoor air flow rate based on a time-of-day economizer. Schedule values equal to 0 disable this feature. Schedule values greater than 0 cause the outdoor air flow rate to increase to the maximum. When an economizer is used in conjunction with the high humidity control option, high humidity control has priority.
```
	
##  Field: High Humidity Control 
HighHumidityControl
```
This choice field establishes whether or not the outdoor air flow rate is modified in response to high indoor relative humidity. Valid choices are Yes and No. If Yes is selected, the outdoor air flow rate may be modified when the indoor relative humidity is above the humidstat setpoint. If No is selected, this option is disabled and the following three fields are not used.
```
	
##  Field: Humidistat Control Zone Name 
HumidistatControlZoneName
```
This input defines the zone name where the humidistat is located. This is the same name used in the {ZoneControl:Humidistat} object. This field is required when the input field High Humidity Control is specified as Yes.
```
	
##  Field: High Humidity Outdoor Air Flow Ratio 
HighHumidityOutdoorAirFlowRatio
```
This input is the ratio of the modified outdoor air flow rate to the maximum outdoor air flow rate. When the high humidity control algorithm determines that the outdoor air flow rate will be changed (i.e., increased or decreased), the operating outdoor air flow rate is equal to the maximum outdoor air flow rate multiplied by this ratio. The minimum value for this field is 0. If this field is blank, the default value is 1. This field is used only when the input field High Humidity Control is specified as Yes. When an economizer is used in conjunction with the high humidity control option, high humidity control has priority.
```
	
##  Field: Control High Indoor Humidity Based on Outdoor Humidity Ratio 
ControlHighIndoorHumidityBasedOnOutdoorHumidityRatio
```
This choice field determines if high humidity control is activated based on high indoor relative humidity alone or is activated only when the indoor relative humidity is above the humidstat setpoint {and} the indoor humidity ratio is greater than the outdoor humidity ratio. Valid choices are {Yes} and {No}. If No is selected, high humidity control is active any time the zone humidistat senses a moisture load. If Yes is selected, the model also verifies that the outdoor humidity ratio is less than the humidistat's zone air humidity ratio. This field is used only when the input field High Humidity Control is specified as Yes. The default value is {Yes}.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Recovery Bypass Control Type 
HeatRecoveryBypassControlType
```
This choice field determines if specialized control is used to optimize the use of heat recovery. Valid choices are {BypassWhenWithinEconomizerLimits} and {BypassWhenOAFlowGreaterThanMinimum}. If BypassWhenWithinEconomizerLimits is selected, heat recovery is disabled any time the controller determines that the economizer is active (i.e., all controls are within limits). If BypassWhenOAFlowGreaterThanMinimum is selected, the model first verifies that the economizer is active and then checks to see if the outdoor air flow rate is greater than the minimum. If it is greater than minimum, then heat recovery (if any) is set to bypass. When this option is used with Time of Day Economizer Control or High Humidity Control, this option has priority. The default value is {BypassWhenWithinEconomizerLimits}.

# ControllerMechanicalVentilation

`Controller:MechanicalVentilation`
```
This object is used in conjunction with an outdoor air controller (Ref. {Controller:OutdoorAir}, Field: Mechanical Ventilation Controller Name) to establish the minimum outdoor air flow rate provided by a mixed air box.
Ventilation standards provide guidance on appropriate levels of outdoor ventilation air required for acceptable indoor air quality. The Ventilation Rate Procedure (VRP) of ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007/2010 (\href{http://www.ashrae.org}{www.ashrae.org}) requires outdoor ventilation rates to be determined based on the floor area of each occupied zone plus the number of people in each zone and considers the zone air distribution effectiveness and system ventilation efficiency. The outdoor air ventilation rate can be reset dynamically as operating conditions change (e.g., variations in occupancy). The Controller:MechanicalVentilation object implements the VRP for calculating these outdoor air ventilation requirements and resetting them based on varying occupancy levels and zone diversification. This is particularly useful for large air distribution systems that serve a number of different zone types with varying occupancy levels. This object can also be used to model the Indoor Air Quality Procedure (IAQP) as defined in Standard 62.1
The first five inputs for this object are the name, the availability schedule, the zone outdoor air method, the system outdoor air method, and the zone maximum outdoor air fraction. The next three input fields define the zone name (or zone list name), the design specification outdoor air object name, and the design specification zone air distribution object name to be applied to this zone (or zone list). The last three fields are extensible.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
The unique user assigned name for an instance of mechanical ventilation. Any other object referencing this mechanical ventilation object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: AvailabilitySchedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
The name of a schedule whose values are greater than 0 when mechanical ventilation, as calculated by this object, is desired. If the schedule's value is 0.0, then mechanical ventilation is not available and flow will not be requested. If the schedule's value is > 0.0 (usually 1 is used), mechanical ventilation is available. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods. This schedule is useful for purging the building of contaminants prior to occupancy (i.e., ventilation rate per unit floor area will be provided even if the occupancy is zero).
```
	
##  Field: Demand Controlled Ventilation 
DemandControlledVentilation
```
This field indicates whether the air loop is capable of doing demand controlled ventilation (DCV) to vary the amount of outdoor air based on actual number of occupants in spaces. Two choices: Yes and No. Default is No.
```
	
##  Field: System Outdoor Air Method 
SystemOutdoorAirMethod
```
The method used to calculate the system minimum outdoor air flow. Several choices are allowed: {ZoneSum}, {Standard62.1VentilationRateProcedure}, {Standard62.1VentilationRateProcedureWithLimit}, {IndoorAirQualityProcedure}, {ProportionalControlBasedOnOccupancySchedule}, {ProportionalControlBasedOnDesignOccupancy}, {ProportionalControlBasedOnDesignOARate}, and {IndoorAirQualityProcedureGenericContaminant}. ZoneSum sums the outdoor air flows across all zones served by the system. Standard62.1VentilationRateProcedure (VRP) uses the multi-zone equations defined in 62.1-2007 to calculate the system outdoor air flow. VRP considers zone air distribution effectiveness and zone diversification of outdoor air fractions. Standard62.1VentilationRateProcedureWithLimit is similar to Standard62.1VentilationRateProcedure, the only difference between the two methods is that Standard62.1VentilationRateProcedureWithLimit doesn't allow the system outdoor air flow to be larger than the design value. IndoorAirQualityProcedure (IAQP) is the other procedure defined in ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007 for calculate the amount of outdoor air necessary to maintain the levels of indoor air carbon dioxide at or below the setpoint defined in the {ZoneControl:ContaminantController} object. Appendix A of the ASHRAE 62.1-2010 user's manual discusses another method for implementing CO_{2}-based DCV in a single zone system. This method (Proportional Control) calculates the required outdoor air flow rate which varies in proportion to the percentage of the CO_{2} signal range and has two choices to calculate occupancy-based outdoor air rate. The ProportionalControlBasedOnOccupancySchedule choice uses the real occupancy at the current time step to calculate outdoor air rate, while the ProportionalControlBasedOnDesignOccupancy uses the design occupancy level to calculate outdoor air rate. The former choice is a good approach to estimate outdoor air rate. However, for practical applications, the zone controller usually does not have the real time occupancy information, and the design occupancy level is assumed. The latter choice is used in the design stage. The ProportionalControlBasedOnDesignOARate uses design outdoor air flow rate to calculate demand outdoor air flow rate. The IndoorAirQualityProcedure-GenericContaminant method calculates the amount of outdoor air necessary to maintain the levels of indoor air generic contaminant at or below the setpoint defined in the {ZoneControl:ContaminantController} object.
Note: When System Outdoor Air Method = IndoorAirQualityProcedure or IndoorAirQualityProcedureGenericContaminant is specified, only the Zone <x> Name fields are used. The other field inputs described below are not used.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Maximum Outdoor Air Fraction 
ZoneMaximumOutdoorAirFraction
```
This positive numeric input is the zone maximum outdoor air fraction. For VAV systems, when a zone requires outdoor air higher than the user specified Zone Maximum Outdoor Air Fraction, the zone supply air flow will be increased (if damper not fully open yet) to cap the outdoor air fraction at the maximum value. This allows the system level outdoor air flow to be reduced while the total supply air flow increases to meet zone outdoor air requirement. Valid values are from 0 to 1.0. Default is 1.0 which indicates zones can have 100% outdoor air maintaining backward compatibility. This input work for single and dual duct VAV systems.
```
	
##  Field Set (Zone Name, Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name, and Design Specification Zone Air Distribution Object Name) 
SetZoneNameDesignSpecificationOutdoorAirObjectNameAndDesignSpecificationZoneAirDistributionObjectName
```
The following three fields are needed to define the parameters for the ventilation. This object is extensible by duplicating these three fields.
```
	
##  Field: Zone or ZoneList <x> Name 
ZoneOrZoneListXName
```
The zone name or zone list to apply the ventilation rates specified in the {DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir} object.
```
	
##  Field: Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name <x> 
DesignSpecificationOutdoorAirObjectNameX
```
The name of the {DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir} or {DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir:SpaceList} object, defining the amount of outdoor air, that applies to the zone or zone list. If this field is blank, the corresponding {DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir} object for the zone will come from the {DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir} object referenced by the {Sizing:Zone} object for the same zone. If no such zone match is found, default values from the IDD will be used for the {DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir} object which is 0.0094 m3/s-person.
If an Outdoor Air Schedule Name is specified in the {DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir} object, the schedule will be applied to all types of outdoor air calculations for the corresponding zone, regardless of the System Outdoor Air Method selected. If the schedule value is zero, then the zone will be completely removed from the system outdoor air calculations.
```
	
##  Field: Design Specification Zone Air Distribution Object Name <x> 
DesignSpecificationZoneAirDistributionObjectNameX
```
The name of the {DesignSpecification:ZoneAirDistribution} object, defining the air distribution effectiveness and secondary recirculation air fraction, that applies to the zone or zone list. If this field is blank, the corresponding {DesignSpecification:ZoneAirDistribution} object for the zone will come from the {DesignSpecification:ZoneAirDistribution} object referenced by the {Sizing:Zone} object for the same zone. If no such zone match is found, default values from the IDD will be used for the {DesignSpecification:ZoneAirDistribution} object which are effectiveness = 1.0 and recirculation = 0.0.
As described previously, the Controller:MechanicalVentilation object works in conjunction with {Controller:OutdoorAir}. As such, the minimum quantity of outdoor air delivered via the mixed air box will be the greater of:
  the minimum outdoor air flow rate calculated by the fields Minimum Outdoor Air Flow Rate, Minimum Limit and Minimum Outdoor Air Schedule Name in the associated {Controller:OutdoorAir} object, or
  the outdoor air flow rate calculated by this object.
The actual outdoor air flow rate may be higher than the minimum if free cooling is available. Regardless, the outdoor air flow rate will not exceed the Maximum Outdoor Air Flow Rate specified in the associated {Controller:OutdoorAir} object or the Maximum Fraction of Outdoor Air Schedule (if specified) times the current system supply air flow rate.

# ZoneHVACEnergyRecoveryVentilatorController

`ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator:Controller`
```
This controller object is used exclusively by the stand alone energy recovery ventilator ({ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator}, see Figure{fig:schematic-of-the-zonehvac}). The purpose of this controller is to simulate economizer operation for the stand alone ERV and provide free cooling whenever possible or modify the outdoor air flow rate during high indoor humidity conditions. During economizer operation, if all of the limits are satisfied, the controller activates economizer mode (fully bypassing the fixed-plate air-to-air heat exchanger or stopping the rotation of a rotary heat exchanger). If any of the selected limits are exceeded, economizer operation is terminated. A time-of-day schedule may also be used to simulate a push-button type economizer controller.
In addition, the outdoor air flow rate may be modified and heat exchange suspended in response to high indoor relative humidities. When the indoor relative humidity exceeds the zone humidistat's relative humidity set point, high humidity control is activated. When activated, if high humidity control is based on the outdoor air humidity ratio and the outdoor humidity ratio is greater than the indoor humidity ratio, high humidity control is terminated.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
A unique user-assigned name for the stand alone ERV controller. Any reference to this controller by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Temperature High Limit 
TemperatureHighLimit
```
The input for this field is the outdoor air temperature high limit ( °C) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air temperature is above this limit, economizer (free cooling) operation is terminated. No input (blank) in this field means that there is no outdoor air temperature high limit control.
```
	
##  Field: Temperature Low Limit 
TemperatureLowLimit
```
The input for this field is the outdoor air temperature low limit ( °C) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air temperature is below this limit, economizer (free cooling) operation is terminated. No input (blank) in this field means that there is no outdoor air temperature low limit control.
```
	
##  Field: Enthalpy High Limit 
EnthalpyHighLimit
```
The input for this field is the outdoor air enthalpy limit (in J/kg) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air enthalpy is above this value, economizer (free cooling) operation is terminated. No input (blank) in this field means that there is no outdoor air economizer limit control.
```
	
##  Field: Dewpoint Temperature Limit 
DewpointTemperatureLimit
```
Input for this field is the outdoor air dewpoint limit ( °C) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air dewpoint temperature is above this value, the outdoor airflow rate will be set to the minimum. No input (blank) in this field means that there is no outdoor air dewpoint limit control. This limit applies to the conditions at the Actuated Node regardless of whether or not there are any other components on the outdoor air path upstream of the mixer.
```
	
##  Field: Electronic Enthalpy Limit Curve Name 
ElectronicEnthalpyLimitCurveName
```
Input for this field is the name of a quadratic or cubic curve which provides the maximum outdoor air humidity ratio (function of outdoor air dry-bulb temperature) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air humidity ratio is greater than the curve's maximum humidity ratio (evaluated at the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature), the outdoor air flow rate will be set to the minimum. This limit applies to the conditions at the Actuated Node regardless of whether or not there are any other components on the outdoor air path upstream of the mixer. No input (blank) in this field means that there is no electronic enthalpy limit control.
```
	
##  Field: Exhaust Air Temperature Limit 
ExhaustAirTemperatureLimit
```
This input establishes whether or not there is a limit control on the exhaust air temperature. The choices are {ExhaustAirTemperatureLimit} or {NoExhaustAirTemperatureLimit}. If {ExhaustAirTemperatureLimit} is chosen, the controller deactivates economizer mode whenever the outdoor air temperature is greater than the exhaust air temperature. If {NoExhaustAirTemperatureLimit} is chosen, no limit check on the exhaust air temperature is performed.
```
	
##  Field: Exhaust Air Enthalpy Limit 
ExhaustAirEnthalpyLimit
```
This input establishes whether or not there is a limit control on the exhaust air enthalpy. The choices are {ExhaustAirEnthalpyLimit} or {NoExhaustAirEnthalpyLimit}. If {ExhaustAirEnthalpyLimit} is chosen, the controller deactivates economizer mode whenever the outdoor air enthalpy is greater than the exhaust air enthalpy. If {NoExhaustAirEnthalpyLimit} is chosen, no limit check on the exhaust air enthalpy is performed.
```
	
##  Field: Time of Day Economizer Flow Control Schedule Name 
TimeOfDayEconomizerFlowControlScheduleName
```
This alpha field is the name of a schedule which controls the change in air flow rate based on time-of-day. Schedule values equal to 0 disable this feature. Schedule values greater than 0 activate the economizer. Note that heat exchange between the air streams is suspended when the economizer is active. This schedule can be used with or without the high humidity control option. When an economizer is used in conjunction with the high humidity control option, high humidity control has priority.
```
	
##  Field: High Humidity Control Flag 
HighHumidityControlFlag
```
This optional choice field establishes whether or not the supply and exhaust air flow rates are modified in response to high indoor relative humidity. Valid choices are Yes and No. If Yes is selected, the supply and exhaust air flow rates may be modified when the indoor relative humidity is above the humidstat set point. If No is selected, this option is disabled and the following three fields are not used. Note that heat exchange between the air streams is suspended during times when high humidity control is active. The default value is No.
```
	
##  Field: Humidistat Control Zone Name 
HumidistatControlZoneName
```
This optional input defines the zone name where the humidistat is located. This is the same zone name used in the Zone Control:Humidistat object. This field is required when the High Humidity Control Flag is specified as Yes.
```
	
##  Field: High Humidity Outdoor Air Flow Ratio 
HighHumidityOutdoorAirFlowRatio
```
This optional input is the ratio of the modified supply (outdoor) air flow rate to the supply air flow rate specified in the Energy Recovery Ventilator:Stand Alone ERV object. When the high humidity control algorithm determines that the supply air flow rate will be changed (i.e.~increased or decreased), the operating supply air flow rate is equal to the supply air flow rate specified in the Energy Recovery Ventilator:Stand Alone ERV object multiplied by this ratio. The minimum value for this field is 0. This field is used to modify both the supply and exhaust air flow rates when high humidity control is active. The supply and exhaust air fan volumetric flow rates must be able to account for the increase in air flow when this input is greater than 1. The default value is 1.
```
	
##  Field: Control High Indoor Humidity based on Outdoor Humidity Ratio 
ControlHighIndoorHumidityBasedOnOutdoorHumidityRatio
```
This optional choice field determines if high humidity control is activated based on high indoor relative humidity alone or is activated only when the indoor relative humidity is above the humidstat set point {and} the outdoor humidity ratio is less than the indoor humidity ratio. Valid choices are Yes and No. If No is selected, high humidity control is active any time the zone humidistat senses a moisture load. If yes is selected, the model also verifies that the outdoor humidity ratio is less than the humidistat's zone air humidity ratio. This field is used only when the High Humidity Control Flag is specified as Yes. The default value is Yes.

# DesignSpecificationOutdoorAir

`DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir`
```
This object allows for the outdoor air requirements to be defined in a common location for use by other objects. This object may be referenced by name from other objects (e.g., VAV terminal units, {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:NoReheat}, and {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}) as required to identify an outdoor air quantity for use by that object. Note that a zone name Is not included as an input to this zone outdoor air definition and the number of people in a zone, zone floor area, and zone volume can only be determined after this object has been referenced by another. A single zone outdoor air definition may be referenced by multiple objects to specify that the same outdoor air requirements are used by those objects {or} multiple zone outdoor air objects may be defined and referenced by other objects as needed. If multiple zone outdoor air definitions are used, each outdoor air definition must have a unique name.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
Unique identifying name. Any reference to this name by other objects will denote that the following outdoor air requirements will be used.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Method 
OutdoorAirMethod
```
The input must be either {Flow/Person}, {Flow/Area}, {Flow/Zone, AirChanges/Hour}, {Sum}, {Maximum}, {IndoorAirQualityProcedure}, {ProportionalControlBasedOnDesignOccupancy}, or {ProportionalControlBasedOnOccupancySchedule}. The default is {Flow/Person}.
  {Flow/Person} means the program will use the input from the field {Outdoor Air Flow per Person} and the actual zone occupancy to calculate a zone outdoor air flow rate. The density of air is measured at IUPAC standard temperature and pressure.
  {Flow/Area} means that the program will use the input from the field {Outdoor Air Flow per Zone Floor Area} and the actual zone floor area as the zone outdoor air flow rate.  The density of air is measured at IUPAC standard temperature and pressure.
  {Flow/Zone} means that the program will use the input of the field {Outdoor Air Flow per Zone} as the zone outdoor air flow rate. The density of air is measured at IUPAC standard temperature and pressure.
  {AirChanges/Hour} means that the program will use the input from the field {Air Changes per Hour} and the actual zone volume (divided by 3600 seconds per hour) as the zone outdoor air flow rate.
  {Sum} means that the flows calculated from the fields {Outdoor Air Flow per Person,} {Outdoor Air Flow per Area, Outdoor Air Flow per Zone}, and {Air Changes per Hour} (using the associated conversions to m^{3}/s for each field) will be added to obtain the zone outdoor air flow rate.
  {Maximum} means that the maximum flow derived from {Outdoor Air Flow per Person,} {Outdoor Air Flow per Area, Outdoor Air Flow per Zone,} and {Air Changes per Hour} (using the associated conversions to m^{3}/s for each field) will be used as the zone outdoor air flow rate.
  {IndoorAirQualityProcedure} means that the program will use the other procedure defined in ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007 to calculate the amount of outdoor air necessary in order to maintain the levels of indoor air carbon dioxide at or below the setpoint defined in the {ZoneControl:ContaminantController} object. Appendix A of the ASHRAE 62.1-2010 user's manual discusses another method for implementing CO2-based DCV in a single zone system. The last two methods of Proportional Control calculate the required outdoor air flow rate which varies in proportion to the percentage of the CO2 signal range and has two choices to calculate occupancy-based outdoor air rate.
  {ProportionalControlBasedOnOccupancySchedule} uses the real occupancy at the current time step to calculate outdoor air rate.
  {ProportionalControlBasedOnDesignOccupancy} uses the design occupancy level to calculate outdoor air rate. The former choice is a good approach to estimate outdoor air rate. However, for practical applications, the zone controller usually does not have the real time occupancy information, and the design occupancy level is assumed. The latter choice is used in the design stage.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Flow per Person 
OutdoorAirFlowPerPerson
```
The design outdoor air volume flow rate per person for this zone in cubic meters per second per person, density of air measured at IUPAC standard temperature and pressure. The default is 0.00944 (20 cfm per person). An outdoor air flow rate is calculated based on the total number of people for all {People} statements assigned to the zone. Occupancy schedule values {are not} applied during sizing calculations and {are} applied during the remainder of the simulation. This input is used if {Outdoor Air Method} is one of {Outdoor Air Flow per Person}, {Sum}, or {Maximum}.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Flow per Zone Floor Area 
OutdoorAirFlowPerZoneFloorArea
```
The design outdoor air volume flow rate per square meter of floor area (units are m^{3}/s-m^{2}), density of air measured at IUPAC standard temperature and pressure. This input is used if {Outdoor Air Method} is {Flow/Area, Sum} or {Maximum}. The default value for this field is 0.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Flow per Zone 
OutdoorAirFlowPerZone
```
The design outdoor air flow rate for this zone in cubic meters per second, density of air measured at IUPAC standard temperature and pressure. This input field is used if {Outdoor Air Method} is {Flow/Zone, Sum} or {Maximum}. The default value for this field is 0.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Flow Changes per Hour 
OutdoorAirFlowChangesPerHour
```
The design outdoor air volume flow rate in air changes per hour, density of air measured at IUPAC standard temperature and pressure. This factor is used along with the Zone Volume and converted to cubic meters per second. This input field is used if {Outdoor Air Method} is {AirChanges/Hour, Sum} or {Maximum}. The default value for this field is 0.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Schedule Name 
OutdoorAirScheduleName
```
This field is the name of schedule that defines how outdoor air requirements change over time. The field is optional. If left blank, the schedule defaults to 1.0. If used, then the schedule values are multiplied by the outdoor air flow rate defined by the previous fields. The schedule values must be between 0 and 1, inclusive.
If this DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir object is referenced by a {Controller:MechanicalVentilation} object (either directly or indirectly through {Sizing:Zone}), the schedule will be applied to all types of outdoor air calculations for the corresponding zone, regardless of the System Outdoor Air Method selected. If the schedule value is zero, then the zone will be completely removed from the system outdoor air calculations.
```
	
##  Field: Proportional Control Minimum Outdoor Air Flow Rate Schedule Name 
ProportionalControlMinimumOutdoorAirFlowRateScheduleName
```
This field is the name of schedule that defines how minimum outdoor air requirements change over time. The field is optional. If left blank, the schedule defaults to 1.0. If used when the field System Outdoor Air Method = ProportionalControlBasedOnDesignOARate in {Controller:MechanicalVentilation}, then the schedule values are multiplied by the outdoor air flow rate.

# DesignSpecificationZoneAirDistribution

`DesignSpecification:ZoneAirDistribution`
```
This object is used to describe the air distribution effectiveness and fraction of secondary recirculation air (return air not directly mixed with outdoor air) of a zone. It is referenced by the {Sizing:Zone} and {Controller:MechanicalVentilation} objects.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
The unique user assigned name for an instance of this object. Any other object referencing this object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Air Distribution Effectiveness in Cooling Mode 
ZoneAirDistributionEffectivenessInCoolingMode
```
The positive numeric input for this field is the zone air distribution effectiveness when the zone is in cooling mode. Default value of this field is 1.0. ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010 provides typical values.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Air Distribution Effectiveness in Heating Mode 
ZoneAirDistributionEffectivenessInHeatingMode
```
The positive numeric input for this field is the zone air distribution effectiveness when the zone is in heating mode. Default value of this field is 1.0. ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010 provides typical values as follows:
```
	
##  Field: Zone Air Distribution Effectiveness Schedule Name 
ZoneAirDistributionEffectivenessScheduleName
```
This optional field input points to a schedule with values of zone air distribution effectiveness. It provides a more flexible way of specifying zone air distribution effectiveness if it changes with time and/or system operating status and controls. If the schedule is specified, the zone air distribution effectiveness in cooling mode and heating mode will be ignored.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Secondary Recirculation Fraction 
ZoneSecondaryRecirculationFraction
```
The non-negative numeric input for this field is the fraction of a zone's recirculation air that does not directly mix with the outdoor air. The zone secondary recirculation fraction Er is determined by the designer based on system configuration. For plenum return systems with secondary recirculation (e.g., fan-powered VAV with plenum return) Er is usually less than 1.0, although values may range from 0.1 to 1.2 depending upon the location of the ventilation zone relative to other zones and the air handler. For ducted return systems with secondary recirculation (e.g., fan-powered VAV with ducted return), Er is typically 0.0, while for those with system-level recirculation (e.g, dual-fan dual-duct systems with ducted return) Er is typically 1.0. For other system types, Er is typically 0.75. Minimum is 0.0, and default is 0.0 for single-path systems (also to maintain backward compatibility). For parallel fan-powered VAV systems, the secondary ventilation path only functions (Er > 0.0) when the fans in the VAV boxes operate, which is during heating. The local ventilation path and the benefits of secondary recirculation disappear during cooling, when the local parallel fans are off (Er = 0.0).
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Zone Ventilatio 
MinimumZoneVentilatio
```
Efficiency}label{field-minimum-zone-ventilation-efficiency}
This optional input sets a minimum on the ventilation efficiency for the zone. It is only used with the Ventilation Rate Procedure (VRP), single-path method. VRP should be chosen in Sizing System, System Outdoor Air Method = Standard62.1VentilationRateProcedure. Single-path method is indicated by leaving the previous input (Zone Secondary Recirculation Fraction) blank or setting it to 0.0. If the calculated value of ventilation efficiency for a zone is less than this value, it is raised to this minimum by raising the zone minimum air flow rate. This new value for zone minimum air flow rate then overrides other defaults and inputs in {Sizing:Zone}.
An example of this in an IDF context is shown:

# SizingParameters

`Sizing:Parameters`
```
This object allows the user to specify global heating and cooling sizing ratios. These ratios will be applied at the zone level to all of the zone heating and cooling loads and air flow rates. These new loads and air flow rates are then used to calculate the system level flow rates and capacities and are used in all component sizing calculations.
The user can also specify the width (in load timesteps) of a moving average window which can be used to smooth the calculated zone design flow sequences. The use of this parameter is described below.
```

##  Field: Heating Sizing Factor 
HeatingSizingFactor
```
The global heating sizing ratio applied to all of the zone design heating loads and air flow rates.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Sizing Factor 
CoolingSizingFactor
```
The global cooling sizing ratio applied to all of the zone design cooling loads and air flow rates
```
	
##  Field: Timesteps in Averaging Window 
TimestepsInAveragingWindow
```
The number of load timesteps in the zone design flow sequence averaging window. The default is 1, in which case the calculated zone design flow rates are averaged over the load timestep.
The zone design air flow rate calculation is performed assuming a potentially infinite supply of heating or cooling air at a fixed temperature. Thus the calculated design air flow rate will always be able to meet any load or change in load no matter how large or abrupt. In reality air flow rates are limited by duct sizes and fan capacities. The idealized zone design flow calculation may result in unrealistically large flow rates, especially if the user is performing the sizing calculations using thermostat schedules with night setup or setback. The calculated zone design flow rates are always averaged over the load timestep. The user may want to perform a broader average to mitigate the effect of thermostat setup and setback and prevent the warm up or cool down flow rates from dominating the design flow rate calculation. Specifying the width of the averaging window allows the user to do this.
For example, if the load calculation timestep is 15 minutes and the user specifies the {Timesteps in Averaging Window} to be 4, the zone design air flows will be averaged over a time period of 1 hour. Specifying 8 would result in averaging over a 2 hour period.
```
	
# OutputControlSizingStyle

`OutputControl:Sizing:Style`
```
As described early in the document (see: EnergyPlus Output Processing), the user may select the ``style'' for the sizing result files (epluszsz.<ext>, eplusssz.<ext>). This object applies to all sizing output files.
OutputControl:Sizing:Style,
       \memo default style for the Sizing output files is comma -- this works well for
       \memo importing into spreadsheet programs such as Excel(tm) but not so well for word
       \memo processing progams -- there tab may be a better choice.  fixed puts spaces between
       \memo the columns
       \unique-object
   A1; \field Column Separator
       \required-field
       \type choice
       \key Comma
       \key Tab
       \key Fixed
```

##  Field: Column Separator 
ColumnSeparator
```
For this field, the desired separator for columns is entered. ``Comma'' creates comma separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplus<sizing type>.csv files are created). ``Tab'' creates tab separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplus<sizing type>.tab files are created). ``Fixed'' creates space separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplus<sizing type>.txt files are created) but these are not necessarily lined up for easy printing.
Note that both tab and comma separated files easily import into Excel\textsuperscript{TM} or other spreadsheet programs. The tab delimited files can also be viewed by text editors, word processing programs and easily converted to ``tables'' within those programs.
```
	
# SizingZone

`Sizing:Zone`
```
The Sizing:Zone object provides the data needed to perform a zone design air flow calculation for a single zone. This calculation assumes a variable amount of supply air at a fixed temperature and humidity. The information needed consists of the zone inlet supply air conditions: temperature and humidity ratio for heating and cooling. The calculation is done for every design day included in the input. The maximum cooling load and air flow and the maximum heating load and air flow are then saved for the system level design calculations and for the component automatic sizing calculations.
The Sizing:Zone object is also the place where the user can specify the design outdoor air flow rate by referencing the name of a design specification outdoor air object. This can be specified in a number of ways (ref. {DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir}).This data is saved for use in the system sizing calculation or for sizing zone components that use outdoor air.
The user can also place limits on the heating and design cooling air flow rates. See {~Heating Design Air Flow Method} and {Cooling Design Air Flow Method} below and the explanations of the various heating and cooling flow input fields.
The user can ask the zone design calculation to take into account the effect of a Dedicated Outdoor Air System on the zone design loads and airflow rates. The design calculation will calculate the heat addition rate to the zone of an idealized SOA system and add or subtract the result from the total zone loads and flow rates.
Latent zone loads can also be calulated when specifying a {Zone Load Sizing Method} other than Sensible Load Only No Latent Load. The design latent cooling and heating air flow will be calculated using the specified supply air humidity ratio and saved for further processing. Depending on the user choice for {Zone Load Sizing Method},  the sensible, latent or largest load will determine the air flow rate used for the simulation. Care should be used to select appropriate values for {Zone Cooling Design Supply Air Temperature}, {Zone Heating Design Supply Air Temperature}, {Zone Dehumidification Design Supply Air Humidity Ratio} and {Zone Humidification Design Supply Air Humidity Ratio} as these values determine the zone sensible and latent mass flow rates. The larger the temperature difference, the smaller the air flow. Similarly, the larger the humidity ratio difference, the smaller the air flow. Coordinating these inputs will provide accurate results for air mass flow rate and which loads (i.e., sensible or latent) are largest.

`DesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizing`
```
This object is used to describe general sizing and scalable sizing methods which are referenced by zone HVAC equipment objects. It is optional input field in zone HVAC objects. If a name of this optional input is not specified or is blank then the sizing method or input specified in the parent object is used.~ If the name of this object is entered, then the values or method specified overrides the sizing method in the parent zone HVAC objects. This object is meant to provide scalable sizing method to users. The name of this object is an optional input field in the zoneHVAC objects. When this name in not specified in the zone HVAC object the sizing method or the value specified in the zone HVAC object will be used.
List of zoneHVAC objects than can reference this object include:
  {ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow}
  {ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalAirConditioner}
  {ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump}
  {ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump}
  {ZoneHVAC:WindowAirConditioner}
  {ZoneHVAC:UnitHeater}
  {ZoneHVAC:UnitVentilator}
  {ZoneHVAC:FourPipeFanCoil}
  {ZoneHVAC:VentilatedSlab}
  {ZoneHVAC:EvaporativeCoolerUnit}
  {ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystem}
The sizing methods input fields available in this objects are for supply air flow and capacity for heating and cooling operating modes. Some zone HVAC equipment has single supply air flow rate input field that serves both cooling and heating operating modes.~ So entering either of the cooling or heating scalable sizing input field is sufficient.~ When there are separate input fields for cooling, heating, no-cooling, and no-heating operating modes, the corresponding input fields are specified.~ The child components supply air flow rate are also sized using scalable sizing methods specified in the parent objects. The methods allow users to enter a fixed or hard sized values, autosizable, or scalable sizing methods.~ Methods allowed for sizing supply air flow rates include: {SupplyAirFlowRate}, {FractionOfAutosizedCoolingAirflow}, {FractionOfAutosizedHeatingAirflow}, {FlowPerFloorArea, FlowPerCoolingCapacity}, and {FlowPerHeatingCapacity}.~ The different sizing options are defined as follows:
  {SupplyAirFlowRate}: entered when it is intended that the user specified either hard value or the simulation engine autosize the supply air flow rates for cooling, heating, and no-cooling or no-heating operating modes.
  {FlowPerFloorArea}: entered when it is intended that the simulation engine determine the supply air flow rates from the user specified {supply air flow rates per unit floor area} and the zone floor area of the zone served by the zone HVAC equipment.
  {FractionOfAutosizedCoolingAirflow}: entered when it is intended that the simulation engine determines the supply air flow rates from the user specified {flow fraction} and {autosized cooling design supply air flow rate}.
  {FractionOfAutosizedHeatingAirflow}: entered when it is intended that the simulation engine determines the supply air flow rates from the user specified {flow fraction} and {autosized heating design supply air flow rate}.
  {FlowPerCoolingCapacity}: entered when it is intended t that he simulation engine determines the supply air flow rates from the user specified {supply air flow per cooling capacity value} and {autosized cooling design capacity}.
  {FlowPerHeatingCapacity}: entered when it is intended that the simulation engine determines the supply air flow rates from the user specified {supply air flow per heating capacity value} and {autosized heating design capacity}.
The~ Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing object also has input fields for sizing or scalable sizing of cooling and heating capacity. However, most of the parent zone HVAC objects do not have input fields for sizing capacities. So, the capacity scalable sizing fields in the parent objects are used for sizing child components capacity sizings.~ The scalable capacity sizing may be indirectly impacted by the scalable supply air flow rates sizing values. Moreover, the autosized cold water, hot water and steam flow rates in the parent zone HVAC objects (e.g. FanCoils, UnitHeaters, UnitVentilators, and VentilatedSlabs) and capacity in child components are determined using the scalable sizing methods. Sizing methods allowed for cooling and heating capacity include: {CoolingDesignCapacity, HeatingDesignCapacity}, {CapacityPerFloorArea, FractionOfAutosizedCoolingCapacity}, {FractionOfAutosizedHeatingCapacity}.
  {CoolingDesignCapacity}: entered when it is intended that user specifies either a hard sized cooling capacity value or the simulation engine autosizes cooling capacity value for the cooling design capacity.
  {HeatingDesignCapacity}: entered when it is intended that user specifies either a hard sized heating capacity value or the simulation engine autosized heating capacity value for the heating design capacity.
  {CapacityPerFloorArea}: is entered when it is intended that the simulation engine determines the cooling or heating capacity from user specified capacity per floor area value and the floor area of the zone served by the zone HVAC equipment.
  {FractionOfAutosizedCoolingCapacity}: entered when it is intended that the simulation engine sizes the cooling capacity from the user specified {capacity fraction} and {autosized cooling design capacity} value.
  {FractionOfAutosizedHeatingCapacity}: entered when it is intended that the simulation engine sizes the heating capacity from the user specified {capacity fraction} and {autosized heating design capacity} value.

The information needed consists of the outside environmental conditions and the design supply air temperatures, outdoor air flow rate, and minimum system air flow ratio.
The outside conditions come from the design days in the input. A system sizing calculation is performed for every design day in the input file and the resulting maximum heating and cooling air flow rates and capacities are saved for use in the component sizing calculations.
Supply air conditions are specified by inputting a supply air temperature for cooling, a supply air temperature for heating, and a preheat temperature.
The system sizing calculation sums the zone design air flow rates to obtain a system supply air flow rate. The design conditions and the outdoor air flow rate are used to calculate a design mixed air temperature. The temperature plus the design supply air temperatures allows the calculation of system design heating and cooling capacities.
```

##  Field: AirLoop Name 
AirLoopName
```
The name of the {AirLoopHVAC} corresponding to this Sizing:System object. This is the air system for which the design calculation will be made using the input data of this Sizing:System Object.
```
	
##  Field: Type of Load to Size On 
TypeOfLoadToSizeOn
```
The user specified type of load on which to size the central system. The choices are {Sensible}, {Latent}, {Total} and {VentilationRequirement}. {Sensible}, {Latent} and {Total} mean that the central system supply air flow rate will be determined by combining the zone design air flow rates, which have been calculated to meet the zone sensible and latent loads from the design days. Latent sizing requires the the zones connected to this air system be sized for latent loads, otherwise sizing will use sensible loads. Additionally, if zone latent sizing is performed and zone latent loads do not exceed zone sensible loads, sizing will use sensible loads. If any zone latent load exceeds a zone's sensible load, latent sizing will be performed. {VentilationRequirement} means that the central system supply air flow rate will be determined by the system ventilation requirement. In addition {Sensible} tells the program to size the central cooling coil using entering air flow rate and air conditions at the sensible load peak; {Total} indicates that the program should size the central cooling coil at the air flow rate and conditions at the total load peak. The central heating coil is always sized at the conditions at the peak sensible heating load.
```
	
##  Field: Design Outdoor Air Flow Rate 
DesignOutdoorAirFlowRate
```
The design outdoor air flow rate in cubic meters per second. Generally this should be the minimum outdoor air flow. It is used for both heating and cooling design calculations. The assumption for cooling is that any outdoor air economizer will be closed. If {Autosize} is input the outdoor air flow rate will be taken from the sum of the zone outdoor air flow rates or calculated based on the System Outdoor Air Method selection (field below).
```
	
##  Field: Central Heating Maximum System Air Flow Ratio 
CentralHeatingMaximumSystemAirFlowRatio
```
The ratio of the maximum system air flow rate for heating to the maximum system air flow rate. The value must be between 0 and 1. For constant volume systems the ratio should be set to 1. This ratio should be set to reflect what the user expects the system flow rate to be when maximum heating demand occurs. This ratio is used in calculating the central system heating capacity. Thus if the system is VAV with the zone VAV dampers held at minimum flow when there is a zone heating demand, this ratio should be set to the minimum flow ratio. If the zone VAV dampers are reverse action and can open to full flow to meet heating demand, this ratio should be set to 1. The default is set to 0.5, reflecting the fact that VAV dampers are typically not allowed to fully open during heating.
This field can be set to {AutoSize}.  When automatically calculated, the ratio is determined from the system heating design flow rate divided by the main (which is usually the max of heating and cooling design flow rates) design flow rate.  The design flow rates are also adjusted to be more accurate by examining each of the air terminals attached to the air system and summing the heating and maximum flow rates.

##  Field: System Outdoor Air Method 
SystemOutdoorAirMethod
```
The method used to calculate the system minimum outdoor air flow. The three choices are ZoneSum, Standard62.1VentilationRateProcedure (VRP), and Standard62.1SimplifiedProcedure (SP). ZoneSum sums the outdoor air flows across all zones served by the system. VRP uses the multi-zone equations defined in ASHRAE Standard 62.1 to calculate the system outdoor air flow. VRP considers zone air distribution effectiveness and zone diversification of outdoor air fractions. VRP may also adjust autosized air terminal maximum and minimum supply flow rates if needed to ensure adequate outdoor air flow rate to each zone. SP is similar to VRP and was introduced in ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2019. The main difference with VRP is that it uses a simplified approach to calculate a system's ventilation efficiency which is in turn used to calculate the system outdoor air flow. Additionally, when set to autosize, the minimum (primary) air flow (or air flow fraction) of these types of air terminals will be calculated following SP: {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:NoReheat} ({Constant Minimum Air Flow Fraction} or {Fixed Minimum Air Flow Fraction}),

# SizingPlant

`Sizing:Plant`
```
The Sizing:Plant object contains the input needed for the program to calculate plant loop flow rates and equipment capacities when autosizing. This information is initially used by components that use water for heating or cooling such as hot or chilled water coils to calculate their maximum water flow rates. These flow rates are then summed for use in calculating the Plant Loop flow rates.
The program will size any number of chilled water, hot water, condenser water and other plant loops. There should be one Sizing:Plant object for each plant loop that is to be autosized.
```

##  Field: Plant or Condenser Loop Name

The electric power consumed by the fan can be directly input or autosized using one of three optional methods.  For fans that can vary the volume flow rate the performance can be described using a separate performance curve or table object. Or for fans with discrete speed control the power fraction at each speed can be input directly with no need for a performance curve.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
A unique name for this fan.  Any reference to this fan by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
The name of an availability schedule for this fan. Schedule values greater than zero means the fan is available. If this field is blank, the fan is always available.
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
The name of an air system node at the inlet to the fan. This field is required.
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName
```
The name of an air system node at the outlet of the fan. This field is required.
```
	
##  Field: Design Maximum Air Flow Rate 
DesignMaximumAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field is the design volume flow rate of fan as installed in the HVAC system, in m^{3}/s. This volume flow rate will be converted to a mass flow rate using an altitude-adjusted standard density of dry air at 20 °C drybulb. This the full-speed flow rate and serves as the upper limit for fans that can vary their flow rate. This field can be autosized.
```
	
##  Field: Speed Control Method 
SpeedControlMethod
```
This field is used to select how the fan speed can be varied. There are two choices, Continuous or Discrete.  Discrete indicates that the fan can operate only at specific speed settings and cannot be continuously varied.  Continuous indicates that the fan speed is variable and can change smoothly up to the Design Maximum Air Flow Rate. This input informs the program how power should be calculated with Discrete control using time-weighted averaging and Variable using flow-weighted averaging. A constant volume or on-off fan should use Discrete with Number of Speeds set to 1.  A variable air volume fan should use Continuous. Continuous requires that a fan performance curve be entered in the input field called Electric Power Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name.
```
	
##  Field: Electric Power Minimum Flow Rate Fraction 
ElectricPowerMinimumFlowRateFraction
```
This numeric field is used to describe how low a variable speed fan can be operated. This value is used to calculate the fan power at low flow rates but does not enforce a lower end of the air flow during simulation. The value is a fraction of Design Maximum Air Flow Rate and should be between 0 and 1. This field is only used when Speed Control Method is set to Continuous.
```
	
##  Field: Design Pressure Rise 
DesignPressureRise
```
This numeric field is the total system pressure rise experienced by the fan in Pascals at full flow rate and altitude-adjusted standard density of dry air at 20 degrees Celsius drybulb. This field is required.
```
	
##  Field: Motor Efficiency 
MotorEfficiency
```
This numeric field describes the electric motor that drives the fan.  Efficiency is the shaft power divided by the electric power consumed by the motor.  The value must be between 0 and 1. The default is 0.9.
```
	
##  Field: Motor In Air Stream Fraction 
MotorInAirStreamFraction
```
This numeric field is the fraction of the motor heat that is added to the air stream.  The value must be between 0 and 1.  A value of 0 means fan motor is located completely outside of air stream and none of the motor's heat is added to the air stream.  A value of 1.0 means the motor is located completely inside of air stream and all of the motor's heat is added to the air stream.  Note that regardless of the value here there will be heat added to the air stream as a result of the work done to move the air, this field is only describing what happens to the heat generated as a result of the motor's inefficiency. The heat lost from the motor that is not added to the air stream can be added to the surrounding thermal zone where the motor is located by entering a zone name in the input field called Motor Loss Zone Name below.
```
	
##  Field: Design Electric Power Consumption 
DesignElectricPowerConsumption
```
This numeric field is the electric power consumption at the full Design Maximum Air Flow Rate and Design Pressure Rise, in Watts.  The value entered in this field is used to determine the fan efficiency. This field is autosizable and defaults to autosize.  When autosized there are three different options available for the method used to size the design power and can be selected in the following field.
```
	
##  Field: Design Power Sizing Method 
DesignPowerSizingMethod
```
This field is used to select how the fan's Design Electric Power Consumption is sized when the previous field is set to autosize.  There are three choices: PowerPerFlow, PowerPerFlowPerPressure, or TotalEfficiencyAndPressure.  The default is PowerPerFlowPerPressure.
When PowerPerFlow is selected, the value entered in the input field called Electric Power Per Unit Flow Rate is used to size the Design Electric Power Consumption. This method is useful during early-phase design modeling when little information is available for determining the Design Pressure Rise.  Although the pressure rise is not used to size the Design Electric Power Consumption it is still used to determine the heat added to the air stream as a result of the work done by the fan.
When PowerPerFlowPerPressure is selected, the value entered in the input field called Electric Power Per Unit Flow Rate Per Unit Pressure is used to size the power. This method takes into account the Design Pressure Rise when sizing the Design Electric Power Consumption.
When TotalEfficiencyAndPressure is selected, the values entered in the input fields called Fan Total Efficiency and Design Pressure Rise are used to size the power. This is the legacy method used by the older fan objects prior to verson 8.6.
```
	
##  Field: Electric Power Per Unit Flow Rate 
ElectricPowerPerUnitFlowRate
```
This numeric field is used when the Design Power Sizing Method is set to PowerPerFlow and the Design Electric Power Consumption is set to Autosize. This value, in W/({\m\cubed\per\s}), is used to scale the Design Electric Power Consumption directly from the Design Maximum Air Flow Rate. This scaling factor is defined such that Design Electric Power Consumption = (Electric Power Per Unit Flow Rate) * (Design Maximum Air Flow Rate).
```
	
##  Field: Electric Power Per Unit Flow Rate Per Unit Pressure 
ElectricPowerPerUnitFlowRatePerUnitPressure
```
This numeric field is used when the Design Power Sizing Method is set to PowerPerFlowPerPressure and the Design Electric Power Consumption is set to Autosize. This value, in W/(({\m\cubed\per\s})-Pa), is used to scale the Design Electric Power Consumption from the Design Maximum Air Flow Rate and the Design Pressure Rise. This scaling factor is defined such that Design Electric Power Consumption = (Electric Power Per Unit Flow Rate Per Unit Pressure) * (Design Maximum Air Flow Rate) * (Design Pressure Rise).  The default is 1.66667.
```
	
##  Field: Fan Total Efficiency 
FanTotalEfficiency
```
This numeric field is used when the Design Power Sizing Method is set to TotalEfficiency and the Design Electric Power Consumption is set to Autosize. This value is used to determine the Design Electric Power Consumption from the Design Maximum Air Flow Rate and the Design Pressure Rise.  The total efficiency is defined such that the Design Electric Power Consumption = (Design Maximum Air Flow Rate) * (Design Pressure Rise) / (Fan Total Efficiency).  The default is 0.7.
```
	
##  Field: Electric Power Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name 
ElectricPowerFunctionOfFlowFractionCurveName
```
This field is the name of performance curve or table that describes how electric power consumption varies with air flow rate.  The independent x variable of the performance curve or look up table is a normalized flow fraction defined as the current flow rate divided by the Design Maximum Air Flow Rate.  The model actually uses the ratio of (moist) air mass flow rates with the numerator taking account of humidity and barometric pressure.  The dependent variable that is the result of the performance curve or lookup table is a fraction that is multiplied by the Design Electric Power Consumption to determine the electric power use as a function of flow rate.  Any of the single-independent-variable curves can be used. This field is required if the Speed Control Method is set to Continuous. This field is used when the Speed Control Method is set to Discrete and the Number of Speeds is greater than 1 and the input fields Speed n Electric Power Fraction are left blank.  Note that the fourth order polynomial in {Curve:Quartic} can be used with the coefficients listed above to replicate the formulation used in the older {Fan:VariableVolume} input object prior to version 8.6.
```
	
##  Field: Night Ventilation Mode Pressure Rise 
NightVentilationModePressureRise
```
This optional numeric field is the total system pressure rise experienced by the fan when operating in night mode using {AvailabilityManager:NightVentilation}, in Pascals. This field allows modeling the fan device with a different system pressure that might occur when implementing a special strategy to precool a building at night using outdoor air with dampers fully open. This field is only used when an {AvailabilityManager:NightVentilation} object is used that specifies the fan's availability schedule. This field and the next one replace the {FanPerformance:NightVentilation} object which is not needed with this fan.
```
	
##  Field: Night Ventilation Mode Flow Fraction 
NightVentilationModeFlowFraction
```
This numeric field is the air flow fraction for the fan speed used when operating in night mode using AvailabilityManager:NighVentilation. This field corresponds to the input field called Maximum Flow Rate in the {FanPerformance:NightVentilation} object and, as is the case there, this field is not currently used by the night ventilation manager (which has its own flow fraction field at present). This is a fraction between 0 and 1 and describes the speed level for the fan relative to the Design Maximum Air Flow Rate. This field and the previous one replace the {FanPerformance:NightVentilation} object which is not needed with this fan.
```
	
##  Field: Motor Loss Zone Name 
MotorLossZoneName
```
This optional field can be used to input the name of the Zone in which the fan motor is located.  If the fan is outdoors, or the motor's thermal losses are not to be modeled then leave this field blank.  If a valid Zone name is entered then the portion of the motor's thermal losses that are not added to the air stream are added to the surrounding thermal zone as internal heat gains.
```
	
##  Field: Motor Loss Radiative Fraction 
MotorLossRadiativeFraction
```
This optional numeric field is used when a Zone name is entered in the previous field to determine the split between thermal radiation and thermal convection for the heat losses from the fan motor. If this field is left blank then all the losses will be convective.  Values should be between 0 and 1.
```
	
##  Field: End-Use Subcategory 
EndUseSubcategory
```
This optional field allows entering a user-defined name for the end use subcategory that will be used to meter this fan's electric energy consumption. If this field is omitted or left blank the fan will be assigned to the ``General'' end use subcategory.  End use subcategories are helpful to organize reports in the tabular summary table and appear on special meter outputs. Any text may be used here to categorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table.
```
	
##  Field: Number of Speeds 
NumberOfSpeeds
```
This numeric field is used to specify the number of different speed levels available when Speed Control Method is set to Discrete. This field and the remaining field sets are not used when the Speed Control Method is set to Continuous.  For a constant volume fan enter a value of 1.0.  A value of 1.0 will use the fan's maximum design and no additional field sets are needed.  When set to a value greater than 1 then a pair of flow and power fraction inputs are provided for each speed in the remaining input fields.
```
	
##  Field Set: (Speed Flow Fraction, Speed Electric Power Fraction) 
SetSpeedFlowFractionSpeedElectricPowerFraction
```
A field set is pair of values for the flow fraction and electric power fraction at each speed. The sets should be arranged in increasing order so that the flow fractions become larger in subsequent field sets.  Typically the highest speed level will match the design maximum and have fractions of 1.0.  This object is extensible, so additional sets of the following two fields can be added to the end of this object.
```
	
##  Field: Speed <> Flow Fraction 
SpeedFlowFraction
```
This is the flow fraction for the fan speed. This value is multiplied by the Design Maximum Air Flow Rate to obtain the flow rate when operating at this speed.
```
	
##  Field: Speed <> Electric Power Fraction 
SpeedElectricPowerFraction
```
This field is the electric power fraction for the fan speed. This value is multiplied by the Design Electric Power Consumption to obtain the power consumption when operating at this speed. This field is optional if a performance curve is used in the input field Electric Power Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name.  If omitted and the performance curve is entered, the power at this speed will be determined using the curve or table.  If the power fraction is entered in this field it will be used instead of the curve or table. This allows either overriding the curve for particular speeds or removes the necessity of creating a curve for discrete speed control.

# FanOnOff

`Fan:OnOff`
```
This object models a constant air volume fan that is intended to cycle on and off in tandem with a cooling or heating system (i.e., AUTO fan control mode). The fan can also operate continuously like {Fan:ConstantVolume}. If modeling continuous operation and this object is used as part of a system that utilizes {Coil:Heating:Fuel}, {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed} or {Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed}, the user should confirm proper air flow rates (coil and fan max flows are equal) and that the coil part-load fraction correlation(s) are appropriate (e.g., part-load fraction is less than or equal to 1 for all values of coil part-load ratio). If modeling multi-speed fan operation, this object must be used as part of a compound object that allows multiple fan speeds (e.g., {AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool}, {ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalAirConditioner}, etc.). In this case, the ratio of the compound object air flow rate to the fan's maximum air flow rate is used to determine the power at alternate fan speeds. The optional input for Fan Power Ratio Function of Speed Ratio Curve Name must be entered to model multi-speed fan operation. An optional fan total efficiency ratio curve is also available to model efficiency differences at alternate fan speeds.

# FanZoneExhaust

`Fan:ZoneExhaust`
```
This fan object differs from the other fans in that it stands on its own in a zone rather than serving as one part of an HVAC air system. This object appears directly in a {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList} object and all the controls are contained within the fan object. The zone exhaust fan model provides a way to include the electrical power used by the fan. It can also impact air flows in central air handlers by decreasing the flow of return air and sometimes increasing the outdoor air flow rate.
There are several control options available for the exhaust fan including: an on/off availability schedule, interaction with system availability managers, minimum zone air temperature control limits and a variable flow fraction schedule.
The way in which the exhaust fan impacts central air system can be controlled by declaring what portion of the flow has been balanced by simple airflow from infiltration, ventilation, or mixing. However, it is important to note that presence of an exhaust fan does not by itself drive any simple airflow such as infiltration, ventilation, or zone mixing. For balancing, the simple airflows need to have their own input objects that need to be coordinated with the exhaust fan. The ZoneAirMassFlowConservation object could be a possible solution that can help with balancing unbalanced airflows by triggering the zone air mass flow conservation when desired. 
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
A unique user-assigned name for an instance of a Fan:ZoneExhaust. Any reference to this fan by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the fan can run during a given time period. A schedule value of 0 indicates that the fan is off for that time period. A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that the fan can operate during the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods. Applicable availability managers (ref. {AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList}) may override this schedule by forcing the fan to be on or off.
```
	
##  Field: Fan Total Efficiency 
FanTotalEfficiency
```
This value is the overall efficiency of the fan, i.e., the ratio of the power delivered to the fluid to the electrical input power. It is the product of the motor efficiency and the impeller efficiency. The motor efficiency is the power delivered to the shaft divided by the electrical power input to the motor. The impeller efficiency is power delivered to the fluid (air) divided by the shaft power. The power delivered to the fluid is the mass flow rate of the air multiplied by the pressure rise divided by the air density. This input value must be between 0 and 1. The default is 0.6.
```
	
##  Field: Pressure Rise 
PressureRise
```
The pressure rise in Pascals at full flow and standard (sea level) conditions (20 °C and 101325 Pa).
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Flow Rate 
MaximumFlowRate
```
The full load air volumetric flow rate (m^{3}/sec) at standard temperature and pressure (dry air at 20 °C drybulb). The program does use local barometric pressure to account for altitude using equation for ``standard atmospheric'' pressure on p 6.1 of the ASHRAE 1997 HOF (SI edition) to initialize the air systems being simulated.
p = 101325*(1-2.25577E-05*Z)**5.2559
where p = pressure in Pa and Z = altitude in m
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
The name of the HVAC system node which supplies the inlet air conditions to the fan. This node should be listed as a zone exhaust node in an associated {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections} object.
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName
```
The name of the HVAC system node to which the fan sends its outlet air.
```
	
##  Field: End-Use Subcategory 
EndUseSubcategory
```
Allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Kitchen Exhaust'', ``Fume Hoods'', etc. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref: {Output:Meter} objects). Any text may be used here to categorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the fan will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.
```
	
##  Field: Flow Fraction Schedule Name 
FlowFractionScheduleName
```
This field is optional. If it is not used then the fan operates at the maximum flow rate. If a schedule is input here, then it should contain fractional values between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. The flow rate that the fan operates will be this fraction times the maximum flow rate. This allows a variable speed exhaust fan to be modeled according to a schedule.
```
	
##  Field: System Availability Manager Coupling Mode 
SystemAvailabilityManagerCouplingMode
```
This field is optional. If it is not used then the exhaust fan is assumed to be integrated with the central air handler's system availability manager. This field can be used to control if the exhaust fan should operate independently or not. For example, when a night cycle availability manager turns on the central air system for freeze protection, this field can be used to control if the zone exhaust fans should also run at the same time or not. The key choice Coupled indicates that the exhaust fan should be integrated with the system availability manager so that the fan runs when the air system is forced to run. The key choice Decoupled indicates that the exhaust fan should operate on its own and ignore the system availability manager's requests so that the exhaust fan can remain off when the air system runs. The default is Coupled.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Zone Temperature Limit Schedule Name 
MinimumZoneTemperatureLimitScheduleName
```
This field is optional. If it is not used then there will be no temperature-related control over the operation of the exhaust fan. If the field is used, then enter the name of a schedule with values for zone temperature values (°C). The fan's control will be based on a comparison between the current zone air temperature and the schedule values. If the zone is warmer than the scheduled limit, then the fan will operate. When balancing with simple ventilation, this feature can be used to coordinate exhaust fan operation with ZoneVentilation:* controls for minimum indoor temperature.
```
	
##  Field: Balanced Exhaust Fraction Schedule Name 
BalancedExhaustFractionScheduleName
```
This field is optional. If it is not used, then all the exhaust air flow is assumed to be unbalanced by any simple airflows, such as infiltration, ventilation, or zone mixing. Unbalanced exhaust is then modeled as being provided by the outdoor air system in the central air system. The modeling of unbalanced will reduce the flow rates at the zone's return air node by the flow rate that is being exhausted and will ensure that the outdoor air flow rate is sufficient to serve the exhaust. If this field is used, then enter the name of a schedule with fractional values between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. This fraction is applied to the exhaust fan flow rate and the model tracks the portion of the exhaust that is balanced. Balanced exhaust is then modeled as being provided by simple airflows and does not impact the central air system return air or outdoor air flow rates. For example, if a kitchen zone with an exhaust fan is designed to draw half of its make up air from a neighboring dining room and the other half from the outdoor air system, then a schedule value of 0.5 could be used here. This input field must be blank when the zone air flow balance is enforced. If user specifies a schedule and zone air flow balance is enforced, then EnergyPlus throws a warning error message, ignores the schedule and simulation continues.
```
	
# FanPerformanceNightVentilation

`FanPerformance:NightVentilation`
```
This object is used for specifying an alternate set of performance parameters for a fan.
These alternate parameters are used when a system manager (such as {{AvailabilityManager:NightVentilation}}) sets a specified flow rate for a central forced air system.
At this time, it can be used with {Fan:ConstantVolume}, {Fan:VariableVolume}, {Fan:ZoneExhaust}, {Fan:OnOff} and {Fan:SystemModel} fans, but not with {Fan:ComponentModel} fans.
The fan model checks whether a fixed flow rate has been set; if it has the fan model will use these alternate performance parameters. Note that it is assumed that the fan will run at a fixed speed in the alternate mode. The inputs needed by this object are the fan name, fan total efficiency, pressure rise, flow rate, motor efficiency, and motor in airstream fraction.

```
	
##  Field: Motor Efficiency 
MotorEfficiency
```
The shaft power divided by the electrical power consumed. Must be between 0 and 1. This is a required field with no default.
```
	
##  Field: Motor in Airstream Fraction 
MotorInAirstreamFraction
```
The fraction of the motor heat that is added to the air stream. A value of 0 means that the motor is completely outside the air stream. A value of 1 means that all of the motor heat loss will go into the air stream and act to cause a temperature rise. Must be between 0 and 1. The default is 1.0.

p = 101325 * (1 - 2.25577E-05 * Z)**5.2559
where p = pressure in Pa and Z = altitude in m. Can be autosized.
Specified or autosized maximum airflow rate (including effects of scaling by Field: Fan Sizing Factor) along with corresponding fan static pressure rise and fan shaft power are reported in the .eio file as, respectively, Design Fan Airflow [m3/s], Design Fan Static Pressure Rise [Pa], and Design Fan Shaft Power [W].

\varphi_{\max} = \frac{30}{\pi D_{fan}^3} ⋅ \max \left( \frac{Q_{fan}}{\omega_{fan}} \right)
\varphi_{max} occurs at minimum {Eu}, which corresponds to maximum speed (high flow) with zero pressure rise. The factor (30/\pi) converts revolutions per minute (rpm) to rad/s. Must be greater than zero.
```
	
##  Field: Motor Fan Pulley Ratio 
MotorFanPulleyRatio
```
The numeric dimensionless ratio of the motor pulley diameter to the fan pulley diameter ({D_{motor,pulley} / D_{fan,pulley}}). If specified, must be greater than zero. This ratio can be adjusted to account for belt slip if the fractional slip is known (multiply the drive ratio with no slip by 1+s, where s is the belt fractional slip). Default is 1.0 if field is blank (leave blank if no belt; i.e., direct drive). Can be autosized (assumes no slip).
Specified or autosized motor/fan pulley diameter ratio is reported in the .eio file as Drive Ratio [-]. Autosized ratio is based on fan speed in revolutions per minute (rpm), calculated at design flow condition, divided by Field: Motor Maximum Speed.
```
	
##  Field: Belt Maximum Torque 
BeltMaximumTorque
```
The required numeric maximum output torque capacity of the fan drive belt (\tau_{belt,max} [N-m]). If specified, must be greater than zero. Can be autosized. Use autosize if no belt (i.e., direct drive).
Specified or autosized belt maximum output torque (including effects of scaling by Field: Belt Sizing Factor) is reported in the .eio file as Design Belt Output Torque [N -m]. Also, calculated maximum belt efficiency corresponding to Design Fan Shaft Power, along with belt efficiency at design flow condition (including part-load effects of oversized belt), are reported in the .eio file as, respectively, Maximum Belt Efficiency [-] and Design Belt Efficiency [-].
```

The output of this curve is used to calculate the duct static pressure set point at each time step. This curve should be valid for the range of duct static pressure set points and volumetric flows, anticipated for the simulation period.
For an ad hoc linear duct static pressure reset scheme, the relation (ref: {Curve:Linear} in Performance Curves) between duct static pressure (P_{sm}, Pa) and flow through the fan (Q_{fan}, m^{3}/s) for Q_{fan,min} \le Q_{fan} \le Q_{fan,max} is:

where {C_1} = {P_{sm,\min }} - {C_2}*{Q_{fan,\min }} and {C_2} = \frac{{\left( {{P_{sm,\max }} - {P_{sm,\min }}} \right)}}{{\left( {{Q_{fan,\max }} - {Q_{fan,\min }}} \right)}}
For {Q_{fan}} < {Q_{fan,min}}, {P_{sm}} = {P_{sm,min}};for {Q_{fan}} > {Q_{fan,max}}, {P_{sm}} = {P_{sm,max}}
The minimum and maximum fan airflows ({Q_{fan,min}} and {Q_{fan,max}}) correspond respectively to the minimum and maximum duct static pressure set points ({P_{sm,min}} and {P_{sm,max}}).
If no duct static pressure reset scheme is used and the duct static pressure set point is constant, then parameter {C_{2}} is set to zero and {C_{1}} represents the constant duct static pressure set point.

# HeatExchangerAirToAirFlatPlate

`HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate`
```
The air-to-air flat plate heat exchanger is an HVAC component typically used for exhaust or relief air heat recovery. The user can choose the flow arrangement type: counter flow, parallel flow, or cross flow with both streams unmixed. The input requires no geometric data. Performance is defined by specifying primary outlet air temperature at nominal (user specified) inlet conditions. In addition, the ratio (h^{.}A)_{p} / (h^{.}A)_{s} at nominal flow needs to be input, where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area, p stands for primary side, s for secondary side.
If the heat exchanger is operated in conjunction with an outdoor air economizer (economizer lockout set to {Yes}), the nominal supply air flow rate should be set equal to the minimum outdoor air flow rate specified in the {Controller:OutdoorAir}. The heat exchanger detects that the economizer is operating by the fact that its inlet air flow rate is greater than its nominal supply air flow rate.

# HeatExchangerAirToAirSensibleAndLatent

`HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent`
```
The sensible and latent air-to-air heat exchanger is an HVAC component typically used for exhaust or relief air heat recovery (Figure 150). Heat exchanger performance can be specified to transfer sensible energy, latent energy or both between the supply and exhaust air streams. The input requires no geometric data. Performance is defined by specifying sensible and/or latent effectiveness at 75% and 100% of the nominal (rated) supply air flow rate at two operating conditions as shown in Table{table:operating-conditions-for-defining-heat}.
% table 30
Note: Conditions consistent with the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute's (ARI) Standard 1060-2001.
This object models the basic operation of an air-to-air heat exchanger. Heat exchange between the supply and exhaust air streams occurs whenever the unit is scheduled to be available (Availability schedule) and supply/exhaust air flow is present. This heat exchanger object can be used in conjunction with a conventional air-side economizer (i.e., specify ModulateFlow in the {Controller:OutdoorAir} object), whereby heat exchange is suspended whenever the air-side economizer (or high humidity control) is active (i.e., air flow is fully bypassed around a fixed-plate heat exchanger or the rotation of a rotary heat exchanger is stopped). This object is also able to suspend heat exchange for the purpose of providing free cooling operation in the absence of a conventional air-side economizer (i.e., specify MinimumFlowWithBypass in the {Controller:OutdoorAir} object).
During winter weather, humid exhaust air entering the heat exchanger can form frost on the cold heat exchanger surfaces, which can reduce air flow and the amount of energy recovery. Several methods are used to control or eliminate frost formation, and the following types can be modeled for this heat exchanger object: supply air preheat, minimum exhaust air temperature, exhaust air recirculation and exhaust only. For preheat frost control, a separate heating coil object must be placed in the supply inlet air stream to keep the air temperature above the frost threshold temperature. The other frost control types are modeled within this object itself (i.e., do not require a separate object to be defined) based on alpha and numeric inputs to this heat exchanger object.
Air-to-air heat exchangers are sometimes controlled to maintain a fixed supply air outlet temperature to avoid overheating when the heat exchanger is heating the supply (primary) air. To model this control in EnergyPlus, a set point manager object is used to establish a temperature set point at the supply air outlet node of the heat exchanger. Wheel speed modulation or plate supply air bypass is used to control the supply air exiting conditions to this set point. The set point for supply air temperature control should be set at the minimum economizer temperature set point if an air-side economizer is also being used by the air system. If frost control and supply air outlet temperature control are used, frost control takes precedence over supply air temperature control (e.g., frost control defrost time fraction is determined as if wheel speed modulation or plate supply air bypass is not used).
To model a sensible and latent air-to-air heat exchanger located in an air loop, the input data file should include the following objects:
  {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem}
  {Controller:OutdoorAir}
  {OutdoorAir:Mixer}
  HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent
  {Coil:Heating:Water}, {Coil:Heating:Electric} or {Coil:Heating:Fuel} (if preheat frost control is to be modeled)
  {SetpointManager:Scheduled} (if supply air outlet temperature control is used)
The sensible and latent air-to-air heat exchanger can also be used in a number of other applications, including conditioning outdoor ventilation air and supplying it directly to a zone without an air loop. See object {ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator} for further details on this specific application.
A description of each input field for this object is provided below.

```
	
##  Field: Nominal Electric Power 
NominalElectricPower
```
The electric consumption rate of the unit in watts. Electric power is considered constant whenever the unit operates. This numeric input can be used to model electric power consumption by controls (transformers, relays, etc.) and/or a motor for a rotary heat exchanger. None of this electric power contributes thermal load to the supply or exhaust air streams. The default value for this field is 0.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Outlet Temperature Control 
SupplyAirOutletTemperatureControl
```
This alpha field determines if the heat exchanger's supply air outlet is controlled to a temperature set point when the heat exchanger is actively conditioning the supply (primary) air. The choices for this input field are Yes or No, with the default being No. When supply air outlet temperature control is used, the wheel rotational speed modulates or supply air is bypassed around the plate heat exchanger to maintain the desired setpoint temperature. A setpoint manager object is required to establish the desired set point at the supply air outlet node (reference: {SetpointManager:Scheduled}). When an air-side economizer is also being modeled for this air system, the heat exchanger is deactivated during economizer operation. Additionally, the set point for the supply air outlet temperature control should be equal to the economizer outdoor air temperature lower limit (reference: {Controller:OutdoorAir}, field Economizer Minimum Limit Dry-Bulb Temperature), however, any temperature set point may be used.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Exchanger Type 
HeatExchangerType
```
This alpha field denotes the type of heat exchanger being modeled: Plate (e.g., fixed plate) or Rotary (e.g., rotating cylinder or wheel). The default choice for this field is Plate . The heat exchanger type affects the modeling of frost control options and supply air outlet temperature control. For rotary heat exchangers, rotational speed is varied to control frost formation or the supply air outlet temperature. For plate exchangers, air bypass around the heat exchanger is used to obtain the desired effect.
```
	
##  Field: Frost Control Type 
FrostControlType
```
This alpha field has four choices: None, ExhaustAirRecirculation, ExhaustOnly and MinimumExhaustTemperature. If this field is left blank, the default frost control type is None . For modeling preheat frost control, specify None for this input field and insert a separate heating coil object in the supply inlet air stream to keep the air temperature above the desired frost threshold temperature.
{ExhaustAirRecirculation}: dampers are used to direct exhaust air back into the zone through the supply side of the heat exchanger when the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature falls below a threshold temperature (defined in the next input field). The fraction of time that exhaust air is circulated through the supply side of the heat exchanger is dependent on the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature with respect to the threshold temperature, the initial defrost time fraction, and the rate of change of defrost time fraction (see {Field: Rate of Defrost Time Fraction Increase}). When exhaust air is being recirculated, no supply (outdoor ventilation) air is being provided through the heat exchanger unit (which may or may not be acceptable regarding ventilation for occupants).
{ExhaustOnly (supply air bypass)}: this control cycles off the supply air flow through the heat exchanger for a certain period of time while the exhaust air continues to flow through the exhaust side of the heat exchanger. The fraction of time that the supply flow through the heat exchanger is cycled off is dependent on the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature with respect to the threshold temperature, the initial defrost time fraction, and the rate of change of defrost time fraction (see {Field: Rate of Defrost Time Fraction Increase}). When implemented in real applications, provisions are usually made to avoid building depressurization when this frost control is operating (automatic or pressure-operated dampers, or a bypass air damper around the supply side of the heat exchanger). For this frost control type, it is assumed that the supply air is bypassed around the heat exchanger during frost control operation (i.e., the total supply flow is not reduced during defrost, but merely bypassed around the heat exchanger).
{MinimumExhaustTemperature}: the temperature of the exhaust air leaving the heat exchanger is monitored and the heat exchanger effectiveness is decreased (by slowing heat exchanger rotation or bypassing supply air around the plate exchanger) to keep the exhaust air from falling below the threshold temperature.
```
	
##  Field: Threshold Temperature 
ThresholdTemperature
```
This numeric field defines the dry-bulb temperature of air which is used to initiate frost control. The default value is 1.7 °C. For ExhaustAirRecirculation and ExhaustOnly frost control, the threshold temperature defines the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature below which frost control is active. For MinimumExhaustTemperature frost control, heat exchanger effectiveness is controlled to keep the exhaust air outlet temperature from falling below this threshold temperature value.
The appropriate threshold temperature varies with exhaust (inlet) air temperature and humidity, frost control type, heat exchanger type, and whether the heat exchanger transfers sensible energy alone or both sensible and latent energy (enthalpy). Typical threshold temperatures are provided in Table{table:typical-threshold-temperatures} below. However, it is recommended that the user consult manufacturer's information for the specific air-to-air heat exchanger being modeled.
% table 31

** To model preheat frost control, specify frost control type as None and place a heating coil in the supply inlet air stream controlled to the keep the air temperature above the frost threshold temperature.
```
	
##  Field: Initial Defrost Time Fraction 
InitialDefrostTimeFraction
```
This numeric field defines the fraction of the simulation timestep when frost control will be invoked when the threshold temperature is reached. This field is only used for the ExhaustAirRecirculation and ExhaustOnly frost control types. The value for this field must be ??? 0 and ??? 1. The default time fraction is 0.083 (e.g., 5 min / 60 min) which is typical for ExhaustAirRecirculation frost control. Higher initial defrost time fractions (e.g., 0.167 = 10 min / 60 min) are typically required for ExhaustOnly frost control. For best results, the user should obtain this information from the manufacturer.
```
	
##  Field: Rate of Defrost Time Fraction Increase 
RateOfDefrostTimeFractionIncrease
```
This numeric field defines the rate of increase in the defrost time fraction as the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature falls below the threshold temperature. This field is only used for the ExhaustAirRecirculation and ExhaustOnly frost control types. The value for this field must be ??? 0. The default value is 0.012 (e.g., 0.72 min / 60 min per degree C temperature difference) which is typical for ExhaustAirRecirculation frost control. Higher values (e.g., 0.024 = 1.44 min / 60 min per degree C temperature difference) are typically required for ExhaustOnly frost control. For best results, the user should obtain this information from the manufacturer.
This value is used to determine the total defrost time fraction as follows:
Total defrost time fraction = Initial Defrost Time Fraction +
Rate of Defrost Time Fraction Increase * (T_{threshold} - T_{supply air inlet})
The model does not allow the total defrost time fraction to exceed 1.0 or be less than 0.
```
	
##  Field: Economizer Lockout 
EconomizerLockout
```
This input denotes whether the heat exchanger unit is locked out (bypassed for plate type heat exchangers or the rotation is suspended for rotary type heat exchangers) when the air-side economizer is operating. Both the economizer and high humidity control (Ref. {Controller:OutdoorAir}) activate the heat exchanger lockout as specified by this input. The input choices are {Yes} (meaning locked out) or {No}. The default input for this field is Yes.

# HeatExchangerDesiccantBalancedFlow

`HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow`
```
This desiccant heat exchanger object is an HVAC component used to model both temperature (sensible) and moisture (latent) heat exchange between two air streams (Figure{fig:schematic-of-the-balanced-flow-desiccant-heat}). The model assumes balanced air flow through the regeneration and process sides of the heat exchanger (i.e., regeneration and process air volume flow rates and face velocities are the same). Heat exchanger performance is specified through a performance data type object (e.g., {HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1}).
Currently, this desiccant heat exchanger model can be referenced by two compound objects: {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted} and {Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System}, both of which are used to provide enhanced dehumidification over conventional systems. If this heat exchanger is referenced by a compound object, the compound object will control heat exchanger operation (i.e., tell the heat exchanger if heat exchange is needed or not for each simulation timestep).
This desiccant heat exchanger object may also be specified directly in an {AirLoopHVAC} (air loop {BranchList}) or in an {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem} ({AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList}) without being referenced by a compound object. If specified directly in an {AirLoopHVAC} or {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem}, then the heat exchanger can be controlled to provide heat exchange based on a maximum and/or minimum humidity set point placed on the process air outlet node (ref. Setpoint Managers). If no humidity set points are provided on this node, then heat exchange will be provided whenever the heat exchanger is available to operate (via its availability schedule) and there is a temperature and/or humidity ratio difference between the two air streams.
Inputs to this model include an availability schedule name, inlet and outlet air node names, and the type and name of the heat exchanger performance data object. A description of each input field for this object is provided below.

A schedule value of less than or equal to 0 indicates that the unit is off for that time period. A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that the unit can operate during the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

```

HeatExchangerPerformanceName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name of the specific heat exchanger performance type object (e.g., {HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1}) that defines the performance for this heat exchanger. A single heat exchanger performance type object may be used to define performance for many HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow objects (i.e., the same name may be used in this input field for more than one balanced flow desiccant heat exchanger).
```
	
##  Field: Economizer Lockout 
EconomizerLockout
```
This input denotes whether the heat exchanger unit is locked out (heat exchanger rotation is suspended) when the air-side economizer is operating. Both the economizer and high humidity control (Ref. {Controller:OutdoorAir}) activate the heat exchanger lockout as specified by this input. The input choices are {Yes} (meaning locked out) or {No}. Economizer lockout is typically {not} used for this type of heat exchanger. For this reason, the default input for this field is No.

# HeatExchangerDesiccantBalancedFlowPerformanceDataType1

`HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1`
```
This object specifies a performance model and model coefficients for a balanced flow desiccant heat exchanger. A {HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow} object will reference a HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1 object. This performance data object is used to specify the thermal performance and electric consumption of the heat exchanger. Some representative inputs for this object are provided in the EnergyPlus Reference DataSets (PerfCurves.idf and AllDataSets.idf).
This model predicts the regeneration air stream outlet temperature and humidity ratio values based on the entering regeneration and process air stream temperature, humidity ratio and face velocity. The process air stream outlet humidity ratio and temperatures are calculated based on a simple heat and moisture balance. The model requires that the user enter the nominal volumetric flow rate and a nominal face velocity, electric power consumption, empirical model coefficients for the regeneration outlet air temperature and humidity ratio equations, and the applicable minimum and maximum values for both the independent and dependent variables for the empirical model coefficients provided. This model is based on the following equations:
  The dry-bulb temperature of the regeneration outlet air is defined using the following equation:
RTO = B1 + B2*RWI + B3*RTI + B4*\left( {\frac{{RWI}}{{RTI}}} \right) + B5*PWI + B6*PTI + B7*\left( {\frac{{PWI}}{{PTI}}} \right) + B8*RFV
where,
RTO = Regeneration outlet air dry-bulb temperature (C)
RWI = Regeneration inlet air humidity ratio (kgWater/kgDryAir)
RTI = Regeneration inlet air dry-bulb temperature (C)
PWI = Process inlet air humidity ratio (kgWater/kgDryAir)
PTI = Process inlet air dry-bulb temperature (C)
RFV = Regeneration (and process) face velocity (m/s)
  The humidity ratio of the regeneration outlet air is defined using the same empirical equation form; however, different coefficients are used as follows:
RWO = C1 + C2*RWI + C3*RTI + C4*\left( {\frac{{RWI}}{{RTI}}} \right) + C5*PWI + C6*PTI + C7*\left( {\frac{{PWI}}{{PTI}}} \right) + C8*RFV
where,
RWO = Regeneration outlet air humidity ratio (kgWater/kgDryAir)
  The process outlet air conditions are then calculated based on the regeneration outlet air conditions (temperature or humidity ratio) calculated above, the actual regeneration inlet air conditions entering the heat exchanger, and assuming the same amount of sensible and total energy transfer across both the process and regeneration sides of the heat exchanger. The difference between the actual inlet air conditions and RTI/RWI/PTI/PWI is made here because user-defined limits for RTI/RWI/PTI/PWI may result in a difference between the actual conditions and those used in the equations shown above (see the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference for further discussion).
A description of each input field for this object is provided below.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for this set of desiccant heat exchanger performance data. Any reference to this performance data set by another object (e.g., {HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow}) will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Nominal Air Flow Rate 
NominalAirFlowRate
```
The nominal air volume flow rate in cubic meters per second. This model assumes balanced air flow (i.e., the same air volume flow rate across the process and regeneration sides of the heat exchanger). The minimum value should be greater than 0. This field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: Nominal Air Face Velocity 
NominalAirFaceVelocity
```
This numeric field contains the nominal air velocity across the heat exchanger face area in meters per second. It is assumed that this air velocity is the same for both sides of the heat exchanger. This value, along with the Nominal Air Flow Rate sets the heat exchanger face area. With this fixed face area, the air face velocity is calculated every simulation timestep based on the actual air volume flow rate for the timestep. The minimum value should be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 6. The default value is 3.0.
```
	
##  Field: Nominal Electric Power 
NominalElectricPower
```
This numeric field contains the nominal electric consumption rate of the heat exchanger in watts. This electric power is considered constant and is consumed only when the heat exchanger operates (e.g., for all or a portion of the simulation timestep, as appropriate). This numeric input can be used to model electric power consumption by controls (transformers, relays, etc.) and/or a motor for a rotary heat exchanger. None of this electric power contributes thermal load to the process or regeneration air streams. The minimum value should be greater than or equal to 0. The default value for this field is also 0.

# CoilCoolingWater

`Coil:Cooling:Water`
```
The water cooling coil (Coil:Cooling:Water) has the ability to give detailed output with simplified inputs, inputting complicated coil geometry is not required by the user for this model instead the coil is sized in terms of auto-sizeable thermodynamic inputs. The coil requires thermodynamic inputs such as temperatures, mass flow rates and humidity ratios.
The coil is sized using auto-sized/user design input conditions and the UA values are calculated from the design conditions. A rough estimate of the coil area is provided along with percentage of surface wet and/or dry. This model uses the NTU-effectiveness approach to model heat transfer and has two types of flow arrangements cross-flow or counter-flow.
The basic underlying idea is - use auto sizable thermodynamic design inputs, calculate the coil UA s, use these UA values and operating conditions from the nodes connections, calculate the outlet stream conditions, and calculate the heat transfer rates.
See section Cooling Coil Model in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details regarding this model.

# CoilCoolingWaterDetailedGeometry

`Coil:Cooling:Water:DetailedGeometry`
```
This detailed flat fin coil model is for continuous plate fins. First, found in Type 12 from MODSIM, but now programmed directly from Elmahdy, A.H. and Mitalas, G.P. Then there was a discontinuity in their original model that was fixed in the EnergyPlus implementation. Now this model can be used in an interval halving solution technique for controlling this coil without the problems of non-convergence.

# CoilSystemCoolingWaterHeatExchangerAssisted

`CoilSystem:Cooling:Water:HeatExchangerAssisted`
```
The heat exchanger-assisted water cooling coil is a virtual component consisting of a chilled-water cooling coil and an air-to-air heat exchanger as shown in Figure{fig:schematic-of-the-coilsystem-cooling-water} below. The air-to-air heat exchanger precools the air entering the cooling coil, and reuses this energy to reheat the supply air leaving the cooling coil. This heat exchange process improves the latent removal performance of the cooling coil by allowing it to dedicate more of its cooling capacity toward dehumidification (lower sensible heat ratio).
Note: Node naming shown in Figure{fig:schematic-of-the-coilsystem-cooling-water} is representative for {HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent}. For {HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate}, the exhaust air nodes are referred to as secondary air nodes.
This compound object models the basic operation of an air-to-air heat exchanger in conjunction with a chilled-water cooling coil. The heat exchanger-assisted water cooling coil does not have an operating schedule of its own; its operating schedule is governed by the availability schedules for the chilled-water cooling coil and the air-to-air heat exchanger. Heat exchange will occur whenever the heat exchanger is available to operate (via its availability schedule) and a temperature difference exists between the two air streams -- there is currently no method to enable or disable heat exchange based on zone air humidity level. This compound object is used in place of where a chilled-water cooling coil object would normally be used by itself.
To model a heat exchanger-assisted water cooling coil, the input data file should include the following objects:
  CoilSystem:Cooling:Water:HeatExchangerAssisted compound object
  Air-to-air heat exchanger object ({HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate} or {HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent})
  Chilled-water cooling coil object ({Coil:Cooling:Water} or {Coil:Cooling:Water:DetailedGeometry})

# CoilSystemCoolingWater

`CoilSystem:Cooling:Water`
```
The {CoilSystem:Cooling:Water} object is a coil system wrapper for water cooling coils. Valid water cooling coils are: {Coil:Cooling:Water}, {Coil:Cooling:Water:DetailedGeometry} and {CoilSystem:Cooling:Water:HeatExchangerAssisted}. This coil system allows users to model the three water cooling coils in airloop main and outdoor air branches. Also this object is designed to model water-side economizers for free pre-cooling when the water-side of the coil is placed on the demand side a condenser loop. As a water-side economizer the {CoilSystem:Cooling:Water} object is placed upstream of packaged DX systems or chilled water main cooling coils. The coil system as a water-side economizer provides free pre-cooling when the condition is favorable. Any remaining system cooling load not met by the water side economizer is provided either by a DX or chilled water cooling coil placed downstream of the water-side economizer coil. The {CoilSystem:Cooling:Water} object does not require {Controller:WaterCoil} and relies on a built-in controller. This coil system uses setpoint based control that varies coil entering water (fluid) mass flow rate to meet user specified temperature or humidity setpoint.\par
Figure{fig:water-side-economizer-coil-system-upstream-of-packaged-dx-system} below shows packaged DX system serving multiple zones and a coil system water cooling object placed upstream of the packaged system. The water-side of the coil system is connected to the demand side of a condenser or plant loop. This coil system configuration provides free pre-cooling when the condition is favorable to operate and there is cooling or dehumidification demand. In this configuration the packaged DX system can be {AirloopHVAC:UnitarySystem} object.
Figure{fig:water-side-economizer-coil-system-in-outdoor-air-system} below shows a packaged DX system serving multiple zones and a coil system water cooling object placed in the outdoor air system. The water-side of the coil system is connected to the demand side of a condenser or plant loop.  This coil provides free cooling to the outdoor air stream when the condition is favorable to operate and there is pre-cooling demand.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the coil system cooling water object. Any reference to this coil system by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the coil system cooling water object air inlet node name.
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the coil system cooling water object air outlet node name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the schedule name which contains information on the availability of the coil system cooling water object to operate. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the coil system must be off for that time period. A value greater than 0 denotes that the coil system is available to operate during that time period. This schedule may be used to completely disable the coil system as required. If this field is left blank, the schedule has a value of 1.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Coil Object Type 
CoolingCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the identifying type of cooling coil specified in the coil system cooling water object. Valid choices for this field are:
 Coil:Cooling:Water
 Coil:Cooling:Water:DetailedGeometry
 CoilSystem:Cooling:Water:HeatExchangerAssisted
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Coil Name 
CoolingCoilName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the coil system water cooling coil.
```
	
##  Field: Dehumidification Control Type 
DehumidificationControlType
```
This alpha field contains the type of dehumidification control. The following options are valid for this field:
{None} - meet sensible load only, no active dehumidification control. Valid with all cooling coil types. When a heat exchanger assisted cooling coil is used, the heat exchanger is locked on at all times. The default is None.
{Multimode} - activate water coil and meet sensible load. If no sensible load exists, and Run on Latent Load = Yes, and a latent load exists, the coil will operate to meet the latent load. If the latent load cannot be met the heat exchanger will be activated. This control mode allows the heat exchanger to be turned on and off based on the dehumidification setpoint. Valid only with cooling coil type CoilSystem:Cooling:Water:HeatExchangerAssisted.
{CoolReheat} - cool beyond the dry-bulb temperature set point as required to meet the high humidity setpoint. If cooling coil type = CoilSystem:Cooling:Water:HeatExchangerAssisted, then the heat exchanger is assumed to always transfer energy between the cooling coil's inlet and outlet airstreams when the cooling coil is operating.
For the dehumidification control modes, the maximum humidity setpoint on the Sensor Node is used. This must be set using a ZoneControl:Humidistat object. When extra dehumidification is required, the system may not be able to meet the humidity setpoint if its full capacity is not adequate. If the dehumidification control type is specified as CoolReheat, then the system may require reheat coil type and name elsewhere. Although the reheat coil is required only when CoolReheat is selected, the optional reheat coil may be present for any of the allowed Dehumidification Control Types.
Valid humidity setpoint managers include:
 SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum
 SetpointManager:MultiZone:Humidity:Maximum
 SetpointManager:MultiZone:MaximumHumidity:Average
 SetpointManager:OutdoorAirPretreat
```
	
##  Field: Run On Sensible Load 
RunOnSensibleLoad
```
This alpha field specifies if the coil system will operate to meet a sensible load calculated from the air flow rates through the coil system, coil system entering air temperature and coil outlet node (control node) temperature setpoint. There are two valid choices, Yes or No. If Yes, coil will run if there is a sensible load. If No, coil will not run if there is only a sensible load. The default is Yes.
```
	
##  Field: Run on Latent Load 
RunOnLatentLoad
```
This alpha field specifies if the coil will operate to meet a latent load calculated from the air flow rate through the coil system, coil system entering air humidity ratio and coil system outlet node (control node) maximum humidity ratio setpoint. There are two valid choices, Yes or No. If Yes, the coil will run if there is a latent load. If both a sensible and latent load exist, the system will operate to maintain the temperature set point and then activate dehumidification control if needed. When only a latent load exists, the system will operate to meet the maximum humidity ratio set point and may require the use of a heating coil and heating coil outlet node air temperature set point manager downstream of this cooling coil to maintain the temperature set point. If No, the coil will not run if there is only a latent load. The default is No.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Air To Water Temperature Offset [deltaC]

```
	
##  Field: Economizer Lockout 
EconomizerLockout
```
When Yes is selected or this field is left blank the coil system will be disabled when the air loop economizer flag is active. Default is Yes.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Water Loop Temperature For Heat Recovery [C] 
MinimumWaterLoopTemperatureForHeatRecoveryC
```
The coil system will be disabled if the plant loop water temperature is below the minimum allowed loop water temperature [deltaC]. To avoid freezing the plant fluid set this value higher than the plant fluid freeze point. Default is 0.
```
	
##  Field: Companion Coil Used For Heat Recovery 
CompanionCoilUsedForHeatRecovery
```
When simulating a wrap-around heat recovery loop, enter the name of the water coil connected to this coil system. If a name is entered in this field the coil system is assumed to be used in a wrap-around heat recovery loop. In this case, the water coil named here should be downstream of the coil system connected on the demand side of a plant loop with only a circulation pump connected to the plant loop supply side. The only coil type allowed is {Coil:Cooling:Water}.

where q is the heat transferred from water to the air in watts; T_{water,\\ avg} is the average water temperature in degrees Celsius (°C); and T_{air,\\ avg} is the average air temperature in degrees C. Or the LMTD temperature difference can be used. This field is used when {Performance Input Method} = {UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate}.This field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Water Flow Rate 
MaximumWaterFlowRate
```

```
	
##  Field: Performance Input Method 
PerformanceInputMethod
```
The user can choose either {UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate} or {NominalCapacity}. If {UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate} is selected, the user must input values for UA of the Coil and Max Water FlowRate of the Coil (and Rated Capacity is ignored). If {NominalCapacity} is chosen, the user must input a Rated Capacity for the coil; UA of the Coil and Max Water FlowRate of the Coil will be ignored. Rated capacity is defined as the heating capacity in watts of the coil at the rating points (i.e., the rated inlet and outlet water/air temperatures defined in the input fields below). The rated capacity is used to calculate a water mass flow rate and a UA for the coil. The default is {NominalCapacity}.
To autosize the capacity, choose {UfactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate} and put autosize as the inputs for {U-Factor Times Area Value, Maximum Water Flow Rate,} and {Rated Capacity}. The program will use the Sizing inputs to size the coil. The rated temperatures (see below) are ignored in autosizing. These are used only when the user is specifying coil performance using the {NominalCapacity} input method.
```
	
##  Field: Gross Rated Heating Capacity 
GrossRatedHeatingCapacity

```
This is the ratio of convective heat transfers between air side and water side of the heating coil at the rated operating conditions. The default is 0.5. This ratio describes the geometry and the design of the coil and is defined by:
ratio = \frac{{{\eta_f}{{\left( {hA} \right)}_{air}}}}{{{{\left( {hA} \right)}_{water}}}}
where
$\eta_f$ is the fin efficiency, (dimensionless);

```
	
##  Field:Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
Schedule that defines when the coil is available. If the schedule's value is less than or equal to 0.0, then the coil is not available and flow will not be requested. If the schedule's value is > 0.0 (usually 1 is used), the coil is available. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.

```
	
##  Field: Degree of SubCooling 
DegreeOfSubCooling
```
Ideally the steam trap located at the outlet of steam coil should remove all the condensate immediately, however there is a delay in this process in actual systems which causes the condensate to SubCool by certain degree in the coil before leaving the coil, this SubCool occurs in the steam coil and this SubCool-heat is added to the zone. The minimum value is 2° Celsius and default is 5° Celsius.
```
	
##  Field: Degree of Loop SubCooling

This coil will be simpler than shown in Figure{fig:example-air-loop-heating-cooling-coil} since it will only have air nodes to connect it in the system. The coil can be used in the air loop simulation or in the zone equipment as a reheat coil. Depending on where it is used determines if this coil is temperature or capacity controlled. If used in the air loop simulation it will be controlled to a specified temperature scheduled from the SetPoint Manager.

# CoilHeatingDesuperheater

`Coil:Heating:Desuperheater`
```
A simplified approach is used to determine the performance of this air heating coil. The model assumes that the heating energy provided by this coil is reclaimed from the superheated refrigerant gas leaving a compressor (i.e., a desuperheating refrigerant-to-air heating coil) and does not impact the performance of the compressor. This coil can be used in air loop simulations but can't be used by certain compound objects (e.g., {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir}, {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:WaterToAir}, or {Dehumidifier:Desiccant:NoFans}) or any air distribution equipment (e.g., {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:Reheat}, {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat}, or {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:SeriesPIU:Reheat}).
The desuperheater heating coil input requires a coil name, an availability schedule, and a heat reclaim recovery efficiency. The reclaim recovery efficiency determines the amount of heat available for use by this heating coil. Approximately 25-30% of the energy rejected by typical refrigeration system condensers is to reduce the superheated refrigerant vapor temperature to the condensing temperature. Recovery efficiencies higher than 30% may cause the refrigerant gas to condense which in turn impacts the performance of the refrigeration system. For this reason, the maximum heat reclaim recovery efficiency for this coil is 30% for most sources of waste heat, including refrigeration compressor racks. The one exception to this 30% limit is a condenser that is part of a detailed refrigeration system. In a detailed refrigeration system, the portion of the rejected heat that lies within the superheated region is explicitly calculated. Therefore, the desuperheater coils supplied by a condenser attached to a detailed refrigeration system are subject to a maximum reclaim recovery efficiency of 90% of the heat within the superheated region.
The next two input items for the desuperheater heating coil are the node names for the inlet and outlet air streams. The following two input fields define the source of heating energy for the coil. This desuperheater heating coil may only be used with direct expansion (DX) cooling or refrigeration equipment. The first of these two inputs is the heating source object type while the second defines the name of the heating source. For proper modeling, the desuperheater heating coil must be placed downstream of a DX cooling coil when reclaiming heat from that cooling coil. Desuperheating heating coil placement is unrestricted when reclaiming heat from a {Refrigeration:CompressorRack} or Refrigeration:Condenser.
The next input field is optional and defines the set point node name if the desuperheater heating coil is to be controlled based on temperature. When a load-based control scheme is used, this field is left blank. A final optional input is used to model parasitic electric energy use of auxiliary equipment associated with the desuperheater heating coil (e.g., solenoid valve).
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field defines a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a desuperheater heating coil. Any reference to this desuperheater heating coil by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the desuperheater heating coil can run during a given time period. Schedule values must range from 0 to 1. A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that the coil can operate during the time period. A value equal to 0 denotes that the coil must be off for that time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Reclaim Recovery Efficiency 
HeatReclaimRecoveryEfficiency
```
This numeric field defines the ratio of recovered waste heat from the superheated refrigerant gas to the total rejected waste heat from the heating source (as if no heat reclaim occurred). Values can range from 0.0 up to a maximum of 0.9 if the source is a refrigeration condenser and 0.3 for all other waste heat sources. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.8 for a refrigeration condenser source type and 0.25 for all other sources.
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node from which the desuperheater heating coil draws its inlet air.
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node to which the desuperheater heating coil sends its outlet air.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Source Object Type 
HeatingSourceObjectType
```
This alpha field defines the source of superheated refrigerant gas from which the desuperheater heating coil recovers energy. Valid choices are:
  {Coil:Cooling:DX}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed}
  {Refrigeration:CompressorRack}
  {Refrigeration:Condenser:AirCooled}
  {Refrigeration:Condenser:EvaporativeCooled}
  {Refrigeration:Condenser:WaterCooled}
When the heating coil source is a DX Coil, the air loop's supply air fan control mode may be auto fan (cycling fan cycling coil), constant fan, or variable volume. When the heating source is a compressor rack for refrigerated cases or a refrigeration condenser, the supply air fan control mode should be either variable volume or constant fan.
NOTE: Use of the desuperheater heating coil in variable air volume systems should be done with caution since the model assumption of a fixed heat reclaim recovery efficiency may not be valid if the air flow rate over the coil varies significantly.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Source Name 
HeatingSourceName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the desuperheater heating coil source (e.g., the name of a specific valid coil (as mentioned in the previous field) which provides waste heat to this desuperheater heating coil).
NOTE: When the heating source is a Refrigeration Compressor rack, the heat rejection location in the {Refrigeration:CompressorRack} object must be Outdoors . If the compressor rack heat rejection location is Zone , the total amount of heat rejection available for reclaim (e.g., by this desuperheater heating coil) is set to zero by the compressor rack object and the simulation proceeds.
```
	
##  Field: Temperature Setpoint Node Name 
TemperatureSetpointNodeName
```
This optional alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node used for temperature-based control (e.g., controlling the heating coil's outlet air dry-bulb temperature to a setpoint). If the desuperheater heating coil is temperature controlled through the use of a Set Point Manager, then the control node specified in the Set Point Manager will be entered here. If the desuperheater heating coil is controlled based on a certain heating load to be met (e.g., using this heating coil as part of {AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool} for high humidity control), this field should be left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Parasitic Electric Load 
ParasiticElectricLoad
```
This optional numeric field defines the parasitic electric load (in Watts) due to control valves or other devices specific to the desuperheater heating coil. The load is applied whenever the coil is heating the air. The model assumes that this electric load is small and does not contribute to heating the air.
Following is an example input for a desuperheater heating coil.

# CoilCoolingDXVariableRefrigerantFlow

`Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow`
```
The variable refrigerant flow (VRF) DX cooling coil model is nearly identical to the single-speed DX cooling coil model (Ref. {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed}). For this reason, an adaptation of the single-speed DX cooling coil model is used to model the variable-speed compression system used in VRF AC systems. The model inputs are quite similar to the input requirements for the single-speed DX cooling coil model, however, the location of a majority of the inputs have been moved to the variable refrigerant flow air conditioner object since multiple DX cooling coils will use the same DX compression system (Ref. {AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow}).
```

##  Field: Coil Name 
CoilName
```
This alpha field defines a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a VRF DX cooling coil. Any reference to this DX cooling coil by another object will use this name. This cooling coil name must be entered in the {AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow} object. No other system type uses this specific coil.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the DX cooling coil availability schedule. Schedule values of 0 denote the DX cooling coil is off. A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that the coil can operate during the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Gross Rated Total Cooling Capacity 
GrossRatedTotalCoolingCapacity
```
This numeric field defines the gross rated total cooling capacity of the DX cooling coil in watts at a rating point of 19.44°C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35°C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The total cooling capacity should be a gross, i.e., the effect of supply air fan heat NOT accounted for.
```
	
##  Field: Gross Ratio Sensible Heat Ratio 
GrossRatioSensibleHeatRatio
```
This numeric field defines the gross sensible heat ratio (sensible capacity divided by total cooling capacity) of the DX cooling coil at rated conditions. Both the sensible and total cooling capacities used to define the Rated SHR should be gross (i.e., the effect of supply air fan heat is NOT accounted for)
```
	
##  Field: Rated Air Flow Rate 
RatedAirFlowRate
```
The air volume flow rate, in {\volumeFlowRate}, across the DX cooling coil at rated conditions. The rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00004027 m^{3}/s and 0.00006041 m^{3}/s per watt of rated total cooling capacity (300 to 450 cfm/ton). The gross rated total cooling capacity and gross rated SHR should be performance information for the unit with at this rated air volume flow rate.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve Name 
CoolingCapacityRatioModifierFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the cooling capacity ratio modifier as a function of indoor wet-bulb temperature or indoor wet-bulb and outdoor dry-bulb temperatures. The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44°C indoor wet-bulb temperature and if a biquadratic curve is used also at 35°C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. This curve is a linear, quadratic, or cubic curve if the cooling capacity is solely a function of indoor wet-bulb temperature (i.e., the indoor terminal units weighted average inlet air wet-bulb temperatures). Without specific manufacturers data indicating otherwise, the use of a single independent variable is recommended for this coil type. If, however, the user has reason to believe the cooling capacity is both a function of indoor wet-bulb temperature and outdoor dry-bulb temperature (and has manufacturers data to create the performance curve), a bi-quadratic equation using weighted average indoor wet-bulb temperature and condenser entering air dry-bulb temperature as the independent variables may be used. See the Engineering Reference for more discussion on using this input field.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve Function of Flow Fraction Name 
CoolingCapacityModifierCurveFunctionOfFlowFractionName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a linear, quadratic or cubic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of total cooling capacity as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.

# CoilHeatingDXVariableRefrigerantFlow

`Coil:Heating:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow`
```
The variable refrigerant flow (VRF) DX heating coil model uses performance information at rated conditions along with performance curves for variations in total capacity, energy input ratio and part load fraction to determine performance at part-load conditions. The impacts of defrost operation is modeled based a combination of user inputs and empirical models taken from the air-to-air heat pump algorithms in DOE-2.1E.
The VRF DX heating coil input requires an availability schedule, the gross rated heating capacity and the rated air volume flow rate. The rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00008056 m^{3}/s and 0.00002684 m^{3}/s per watt of gross rated heating capacity.
Two performance curves are required. The first performance curve defines the heating capacity as a function of indoor air dry-bulb and outdoor condenser entering air dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperature. The outdoor air temperature type is specified in the variable refrigerant flow air-to-air heat pump object. The second performance curve defines the change in heating capacity as a function of air flow fraction. Each of these performance curves are further discussed here.
  Heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature, specified in Heat Pump)
The heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor wet-bulb temperature and indoor air dry-bulb temperature. The curve is normalized to 1 at 21.11°C indoor dry-bulb temperature and if a biquadratic curve is used also at 6.11°C outdoor wet-bulb or 8.33°C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The outdoor air temperature type is specified in the variable refrigerant flow air-to-air heat pump object. Users have the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a tri-quadratic curve with three independent variables. The tri-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the combined total capacity of all indoor units connected to the heat pump condenser and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity to give the gross heating capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature) and the combination ratio of the installed system.
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
  Heating capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction, specified in DX coil)
The heating capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity and the heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross heating capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.

##  Field: Heating Capacity Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve Name 
HeatingCapacityRatioModifierFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the heating capacity ratio modifier as a function of indoor dry-bulb temperature or indoor dry-bulb and outdoor wet-bulb temperatures. This curve is a linear, quadratic, or cubic curve if the heating capacity is solely a function of indoor dry-bulb temperature (i.e., the indoor terminal units weighted average inlet air dry-bulb temperatures). Without specific manufacturers data indicating otherwise, the use of a single independent variable is recommended for this coil type. If, however, the user has reason to believe the heating capacity is both a function of indoor dry-bulb temperature and outdoor wet-bulb temperature (and has manufacturers data to create the performance curve), a bi-quadratic equation using weighted average indoor dry-bulb temperature and condenser entering air wet-bulb temperature as the independent variables may be used. See the Engineering Reference for more discussion on using this input field.
Note: The choice of using either outdoor dry-bulb temperature or outdoor wet-bulb temperature as the independent variable in this performance curve is set in the parent object AirConditioner: VariableRefrigerantFlow.

```
This alpha field defines the name of a linear, quadratic or cubic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of heating capacity as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity and the heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross heating capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.

This coil will be simpler than shown in Figure{fig:example-air-loop-heating-cooling-coil} since it will only have air nodes to connect it in the system. The coil can be used in the air loop simulation or in the zone equipment as a reheat coil. Depending on where it is used determines if this coil is temperature or capacity controlled. If used in the air loop simulation it will be controlled to a specified temperature scheduled from the Setpoint Manager. If it is used in zone equipment, it will be controlled from the zone thermostat by meeting the zone demand.

```
This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of fuel consumption rate by the heating coil as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible heating load/nominal capacity of the heating coil). For any simulation timestep, the nominal fuel consumption rate (heating load/burner efficiency) is divided by the part-load fraction (PLF) if a part-load curve has been defined. The part-load curve accounts for efficiency losses due to transient coil operation.
The part-load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the heating coil runs continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 ( 0 <= PLR < 1), the following rules apply:
PLF >= 0.7 and PLF >= PLR
If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the heating coil is defined a PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issues and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.

# CoilCoolingDXSingleSpeed

`Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed`
```
This DX cooling coil input requires an availability schedule, the gross rated total cooling capacity, the gross rated SHR, the gross rated COP, and the rated air volume flow rate. The latter 4 inputs determine the coil performance at the rating point (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7°C drybulb/19.4°C wetbulb and air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35°C drybulb/23.9°C wetbulb). The rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00004027 m^{3}/s and 0.00006041 m^{3}/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (300 to 450 cfm/ton).
The rated volumetric air flow to total cooling capacity ratio for 100% dedicated outdoor air (DOAS) application DX cooling coils should be between 0.00001677 (m3/s)/W (125 cfm/ton) and 0.00003355 (m3/s)/W (250 cfm/ton).
Pumped refrigerant economizer integrated with the single speed DX cooling coil model will use exactly the same model except that performance curves use lookup table to cover the pumped refrigerant economizer and the compressor operating ranges. One or two independent variables may used to represent the performance data.
This model requires five (5) curves as follows:
  The total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) is a curve with two independent variables: wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44°C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35°C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). This curve is typically a biquadratic but any curve or table with two independent variables can be used.
  The total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a curve or lookup table with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variablecan be used.
  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) is a curve with two independent variables: wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44°C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35°C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). This curve is typically a biquadratic but any curve or table with two independent variables can be used.
  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a curve or lookup table with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variablecan be used.
  The part load fraction correlation (function of part load ratio) is a curve or a lookup table with the independent variable being part load ratio (sensible cooling load / steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The curve should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variablecan be used.
The curves are simply specified by name. Curve inputs are described in the curve manager section of this document (see Performance Curves in this document).
The next four input fields are optional and relate to the degradation of latent cooling capacity when the supply air fan operates continuously while the cooling coil/compressor cycle on and off to meet the cooling load. The fan operating mode is determined in the parent object and is considered to either be constant (e.g.~{CoilSystem:Cooling:DX}) or can be scheduled (e.g.~{AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool}). When scheduled, the schedule value must be greater than 0 to calculate degradation of latent cooling capacity. At times when the parent object's supply air fan operating mode schedule is 0, latent degradation will be ignored. When modeling latent capacity degradation, these next four input fields must all have positive values.
The next input specifies the outdoor air node used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is left blank, the outdoor temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must be listed in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name must be specified in an {OutdoorAir:NodeList} object where the outdoor temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data.
The next input describes the type of outdoor condenser coil used with the DX cooling coil (Air Cooled or Evap Cooled). The following three inputs are required when modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser: evaporative condenser effectiveness, evaporative condenser air volume flow rate, and the power consumed by the evaporative condenser pump. Crankcase heater capacity and cutout temperature are entered in the next two input fields. These two fields for this object define the name of the water storage tank for supply and condensate collection. See section DX Cooling Coil Model in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details regarding this model.
The last two input fields following the Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name are the Sensible Heat Ratio (SHR) modifier curve names for temperature and flow fraction. These two input fields are optional and used only when a user intends to override SHR calculated using the apparatus dew point (ADP) and bypass factor (BF) method. See section SHR Calculation Using User Specified SHR Modifier Curves in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details.

The coefficient of performance is the ratio of the gross total cooling capacity in watts to electrical power input in watts of the DX cooling coil unit at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7°C drybulb/19.4°C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35°C drybulb/ 23.9°C wetbulb, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field rated air flow rate below). The input power includes electric power for the compressor(s) and condenser fan(s) but does not include the power consumption of the supply air fan. The gross COP should NOT account for the supply air fan. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 3.0.
```
	
##  Field: Rated Air Flow Rate 
RatedAirFlowRate

These metrics will be outputs in the EnergyPlus eio file (ref. EnergyPlus Engineering Reference, 15.2 Coils) and also in the predefined tabular output reports (Output:Table:SummaryReports object, Equipment Summary).

The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point. This curve is typically a biquadratic but any curve or table with two independent variables can be used.
```
	
##  Field: Total Cooling Capacity Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name 
TotalCoolingCapacityFunctionOfFlowFractionCurveName
```
The name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the gross total cooling capacity as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.
```
	
##  Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name 
EnergyInputRatioFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
The name of a performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point. This curve is typically a biquadratic but any curve or table with two independent variables can be used.
```
	
##  Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name 
EnergyInputRatioFunctionOfFlowFractionCurveName
```
The name of a performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variable can be used.
```
	
##  Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name 
PartLoadFractionCorrelationCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variablecan be used.
The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 <= PLR < 1), the following rules apply:
PLF >= 0.7 and PLF >= PLR
If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.
A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:
       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)
If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:
       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)

Suggested value is 1.5; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX}) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]); and this field, the previous field and the next two fields must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Cycling Rate

```
	
##  Field: Condenser Air Inlet Node Name 
CondenserAirInletNodeName
```
This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air temperature entering the condenser (dry-bulb or wet-bulb) is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data.

The type of condenser used by the DX cooling coil. Valid choices for this input field are {AirCooled} or {EvaporativelyCooled}. The default for this field is {AirCooled}.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporative Condenser Effectiveness 
EvaporativeCondenserEffectiveness
```
The effectiveness of the evaporative condenser, which is used to determine the temperature of the air entering the outdoor condenser coil as follows:
Tcond inlet =  \left( {Twb,o} \right)   +   \left( {1 - EvapCondEffectiveness} \right)\left( {Tdb,o   - Twb,o} \right)
where
{T_{cond\\ inlet}} = the temperature of the air entering the condenser coil (C)
{T_{wb,o}} = the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)
{T_{db,o}} = the dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)
The resulting condenser inlet air temperature is used by the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature). The default value for this field is 0.9, although valid entries can range from 0.0 to 1.0. This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.
If the user wants to model an air-cooled condenser, they should simply specify AirCooled in the field Condenser Type. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature.
If the user wishes to model an evaporative-cooled condenser AND they have performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled and the evaporative condenser effectiveness value should be entered as 1.0. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil.
If the user wishes to model an air-cooled condenser that has evaporative media placed in front of it to cool the air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled. The user must also enter the appropriate evaporative effectiveness for the media. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Be aware that the evaporative media will significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the condenser coil, so the Total Cooling Capacity and EIR Modifier Curves must be valid for the expected range of dry-bulb temperatures that will be entering the condenser coil.

This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporative Condenser Pump Rated Power Consumption 
EvaporativeCondenserPumpRatedPowerConsumption
```
The rated power of the evaporative condenser water pump in Watts. This value is used to calculate the power required to pump the water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The default value for this input field is zero, but it is autosizable (equivalent to 0.004266 W per watt [15 W/ton] of rated total cooling capacity). This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.
```
	
##  Field: Crankcase Heater Capacity

# CoilCoolingDXTwoSpeed

`Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed`
```
This component models a two-speed (or variable speed) DX compressor and fan. The method is based on the model used for the cycling, single speed DX unit. The single speed unit is described by single full load capacity, SHR, COP, and air flow rate at rated conditions. Off rated full load performance is obtained by the use of 4 modifier curves. At partial load the unit cycles on/off and the cycling losses are described by a part load fraction curve.
The multispeed unit is described by specifying the performance at two states: high speed compressor, high speed fan; and low speed compressor, low speed fan. When the unit load is above the high speed capacity, the unit runs with high speed compressor and fan. When the load on the unit is below the high speed capacity but above the low speed capacity, the unit will run with performance intermediate between high speed and low speed. When the load is less than the low speed capacity, the unit will cycle on/off just like the single speed unit.
The multispeed unit model requires 2 full sets of performance data. There must be a high and low speed capacity, SHR, COP, and evaporator air flow rate; as well as high and low speed performance curves total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) and energy input ratio modifier curve (function of temperature).
The multispeed DX component should be used for all cases in which a DX VAV system is being simulated. Obviously this model in which performance is obtained by interpolating between 2 specified states - is an oversimplification of how real multi-speed and variable speed DX cooling units are controlled. But detailed descriptions of how actual units perform and are controlled are not available. This model should give a good average prediction of multispeed and variable speed DX cooling unit performance. The last four input fields following the Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name are the Sensible Heat Ratio (SHR) modifier curvenames for temperature and flow fraction for high and low speed DX cooling coils. These four input fields are optional and used only when a user intends to override SHR calculated using the apparatus dew point (ADP) and bypass factor (BF) method. See section SHR Calculation Using User Specified SHR Modifier Curves in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details.

##  Field: Unit Internal Static Air Pressure 
UnitInternalStaticAirPressure
```
This field is to specify the internal static air pressure, in units of Pascals, associated with the unit s supply air flow for rating purposes. This field does not affect the performance during operation. The air pressure drop/rise input here should be internal in the sense that it is for the entire package of unitary equipment as it would be tested in a laboratory (including other non-cooling sections inside the package for filters, dampers, and or heating coils) but none of the external pressure drop for distributing supply air throughout the building. This is different from the input field called Pressure Rise in the fan object which includes both the external static pressure and the internal static pressure.
If this coil is used with a {Fan:VariableVolume} to model a packaged variable-air-volume unit, then ratings for  EER, IEER, SEER, and Standard Rating (Net) Cooling Capacity will be calculated as defined ANSI/AHRI Standard 340/360 standard.  See also - the fields High Speed 2017 Rated Evaporator Fan Power Per Volume Flow Rate and Low Speed 2017 Rated Evaporator Fan Power Per Volume Flow Rate, which are also used to calculate the 2017 version of these standard ratings. The 2017 standard ratings are reported to the EIO file and to the predefined output table 2017 Standard Ratings for DX Coils.
Additionally, a newer definition for calculating EER, IEER, SEER2, and Standard Rating (Net) Cooling Capacity, was published in the 2022 version of AHRI 340-360.  These ratings are calculated using values in the fields High Speed 2023 Rated Evaporator Fan Power Per Volume Flow Rate and Low Speed 2023 Rated Evaporator Fan Power Per Volume Flow Rate  The 2023 standard ratings are reported to the EIO file and to the predefined output table 2023 Standard Ratings for DX Coils, which are also used to calculate the 2023 version of these standard ratings.

The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. This curve is applied only at the high speed compressor, high speed fan operating point. There is no corresponding curve for the low speed operating point.
```
	
##  Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name

The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point. This curve is used for performance at the high speed compressor, high speed fan operating point.
```
	
##  Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name 
EnergyInputRatioFunctionOfFlowFractionCurveName
```
The name of a quadratic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating.

##  Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name 
PartLoadFractionCorrelationCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.
The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 <= PLR < 1), the following rules apply:
PLF >= 0.7 and PLF >= PLR
If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.
A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:
       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)
If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:
       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)

The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point. This curve is used for performance at the low speed compressor, low speed fan operating point.

##  Field: High Speed Evaporative Condenser Effectiveness 
HighSpeedEvaporativeCondenserEffectiveness
```
The effectiveness of the evaporative condenser at high compressor/fan speed, which is used to determine the temperature of the air entering the outdoor condenser coil as follows:
Tcond inlet =  \left( {Twb,o} \right)   +   \left( {1 - EvapCondEffectivenes{s_{HighSpeed}}} \right)\left( {Tdb,o   - Twb,o} \right)
where
{T_{cond\\ inlet}} = the temperature of the air entering the condenser coil (C)
{T_{wb,o}} = the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)
{T_{db,o}} = the dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)
The resulting condenser inlet air temperature is used by the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature). The default value for this field is 0.9, although valid entries can range from 0.0 to 1.0. This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.
If the user wants to model an air-cooled condenser, they should simply specify AirCooled in the field Condenser Type. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature.
If the user wishes to model an evaporative-cooled condenser AND they have performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled and the evaporative condenser effectiveness value should be entered as 1.0. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil.
If the user wishes to model an air-cooled condenser that has evaporative media placed in front of it to cool the air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled. The user must also enter the appropriate evaporative effectiveness for the media. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Be aware that the evaporative media will significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the condenser coil, so the Total Cooling Capacity and EIR Modifier Curves must be valid for the expected range of dry-bulb temperatures that will be entering the condenser coil.

# CoilCoolingDXTwoStageWithHumidityControlMode

`Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode`
```
The multimode DX coil is functionally equivalent to {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed} but with multiple performance modes. It is capable of modeling two-stage DX units and units with an enhanced dehumidification mode such as coil bypass or subcool reheat. This object contains one-time specifications for the DX unit such as node names and crankcase heater specifications. It references one or more {CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling} objects which define the performance for each mode of operation. It can have up to 4 performance modes to accommodate a 2-stage 2-mode unit.
The multimode DX coil can be used only as a component of {AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem}, {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX} or {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool:VAVChangeoverBypass} (parent object). These parent objects pass a load and dehumidification mode to this coil. If the coil has 2 capacity stages, the multimode coil model determines the stage sequencing.

SupplyWaterStorageTankName
```
This field is optional. It is used to describe where the coil obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the cooler will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a Water Storage Tank object is used here, then the cooler will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the coil will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank.

This numeric field defines the minimum outdoor air dry-bulb temperature where the cooling coil compressor turns off. If this input field is left blank, the value defaults to that specified in the IDD (e.g., -25°C). If this field is not included in the input, the default value is -25°C.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Capacity 
BasinHeaterCapacity
```
This numeric field contains the capacity of the DX coil's electric evaporative cooler basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field.

```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name 
BasinHeaterOperatingScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled.

# CoilCoolingDXMultiSpeed

`Coil:Cooling:DX:MultiSpeed`
```
This component models a DX cooling unit with multiple discrete levels of cooling capacity. Depending on input choices, the user can model a single compressor with multiple operating speeds, or a unit with a single cooling coil fed by multiple compressors (e.g., row split or intertwined coil circuiting). Currently, this cooling coil can only be referenced by a {AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem} or {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:Multispeed} object. Refer to {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode} if the user wishes to model a cooling coil with discrete levels of cooling and the possibility of air bypass during low speed operation (e.g. face-split coil circuiting), or if cooling coil operation based on dehumidification requirements is desired.
The multispeed DX cooling coil can have from two to four operating speeds. When the coil operates at Speed 1 (the lowest speed), its performance is very similar to the single speed DX coil where the impacts of part-load ratio and latent capacity degradation can be included. When the coil operates at higher speeds (above Speed 1), the linear approximation methodology is applied. The coil outputs at two consecutive speeds are linearly interpolated to meet the required cooling capacity during an HVAC system timestep. When the coil performs above the lowest speed, the user can chose if they want to include part-load ratio and latent capacity degradation impacts at the higher speeds.
The multispeed unit is described by specifying the performance at different operating speeds. Each speed has its own set of input specifications: full load capacity, SHR, COP and air flow rate at rated conditions, along with modifier curves to determine performance when actual operating conditions are different from the rated conditions.
The coil operates to meet the sensible capacity being requested. When this requested capacity is above the sensible capacity of the highest operating speed, the coil runs continuously at the highest speed. When the requested capacity is between the sensible capacities of two consecutive speeds, the unit will operate a portion of the time at each speed to meet the request. When the requested capacity is less than the low speed (Speed 1) capacity, the unit will cycle on/off as needed.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
A unique user-assigned name for an instance of a multispeed DX cooling coil. Any reference to this DX coil by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the DX cooling coil can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
The name of the HVAC system node from which the DX cooling coil draws its inlet air.
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName
```
The name of the HVAC system node to which the DX cooling coil sends its outlet air.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Air Inlet Node Name 
CondenserAirInletNodeName
```
This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air temperature entering the condenser (dry-bulb or wet-bulb) is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an {OutdoorAir:NodeList} object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Type 
CondenserType
```
The type of condenser used by the multispeed DX cooling coil. Valid choices for this input field are AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled. The default for this field is AirCooled.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name 
SupplyWaterStorageTankName
```
This field is optional. It is used to describe where the coil obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the evaporative cooler will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a Water Storage Tank object is used here, then the cooler will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the coil will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However, if the tank cannot provide all the water the cooler needs, then the cooler will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as StarvedWater).
```
	
##  Field: Condensate Collection Water Storage Tank Name 
CondensateCollectionWaterStorageTankName
```
This field is optional. It is used to describe where condensate from the coil is collected. If blank or omitted, then any coil condensate is discarded. Enter the name of Water Storage Tank object defined elsewhere and the condensate will then be collected in that tank.
```
	
##  Field: Apply Part Load Fraction to Speeds Greater than 1 
ApplyPartLoadFractionToSpeedsGreaterThan1
```
This field determines whether part-load impacts on coil energy use are applied when the coil is operating at speeds greater than speed 1. The allowed choices are Yes or No, with the default being No if this field is left blank. Other input fields in this object allow the user to specify a part-load fraction correlation for each speed to account for compressor start up losses (cycle on/off). For the case of a single multi-speed compressor, the part load losses may only be significant when the compressor cycles between speed 1 and off, but the losses may be extremely small when the compressor operates between speed 1 and speed 2 (or between speeds 2 and 3, etc.). In this case, the user may chose to specify NO for this input field to neglect part-load impacts on energy use at higher operating speeds. If part-load impacts on coil energy use are thought to be significant (e.g., interwined cooling coil with multiple compressors feeding individual refrigerant circuits), then the user may chose to specify YES and the part-load fraction correlations specified for speeds 2 through 4 will be applied as appropriate. The selection for this input field does not affect part-load impacts when the compressor cycles between speed 1 and off (i.e., the part-load fraction correlation for speed 1 is always applied).
```
	
##  Field: Apply Latent Degradation to Speeds Greater than 1 
ApplyLatentDegradationToSpeedsGreaterThan1
```
This field determines whether latent capacity degradation is applied when the coil is operating at speeds greater than speed 1. The allowed choices are Yes or No, with the default being No if this field is left blank. Other input fields in this object allow the user to specify latent capacity degradation at each speed.
The latent capacity degradation model only applies when the ContinuousFanWithCyclingCompressor supply air fan operating mode is specified, to account for moisture evaporation from the wet cooling coil when the compressor cycles off but the supply air fan continues to operate. For the case of a single multi-speed compressor, latent capacity degradation may only be significant when the compressor cycles between speed 1 and off, but the losses may be extremely small when the compressor operates between speed 1 and speed 2 (or between speeds 2 and 3, etc.). In this case, the user may chose to specify NO for this input field to neglect latent capacity degradation impacts at higher operating speeds. If latent capacity degradation is thought to be significant (e.g., interwined or row-split cooling coil with multiple compressors feeding individual refrigerant circuits), then the user may chose to specify YES and the latent capacity degradation model will be applied for speeds 2 through 4 as appropriate. The selection for this input field does not affect latent capacity degradation between speed 1 and off.
```
	
##  Field: Crankcase Heater Capacity 
CrankcaseHeaterCapacity

This numeric field defines the crankcase heater capacity in Watts. When the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the value specified in the input field Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation (described below), the crankcase heater is enabled during the time that the compressor is not running. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0. To simulate a unit without a crankcase heater, enter a value of 0.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation 
MaximumOutdoorDryBulbTemperatureForCrankcaseHeaterOperation
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which the compressor's crankcase heater is disabled. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0.0°C. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 10°C.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Compressor Operation 
MinimumOutdoorDryBulbTemperatureForCompressorOperation
```
This numeric field defines the minimum outdoor air dry-bulb temperature where the cooling coil compressor turns off. If this input field is left blank, the value defaults to that specified in the IDD (e.g., -25°C).
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Capacity 
BasinHeaterCapacity
```
This numeric field contains the capacity of the DX coil's electric evaporative cooler basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the DX coil is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature 
BasinHeaterSetpointTemperature
```
This numeric field contains the set point temperature (°C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the DX coil is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2°C, and the default value is 2°C if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name 
BasinHeaterOperatingScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the DX coil is off.
```
	
##  Field: Fuel Type 
FuelType
```
This alpha field determines the type of fuel that this cooling coil uses. This field has seven choices: Electricity, NaturalGas, Propane, Coal, Diesel, Gasoline, FuelOilNo1, FuelOilNo2, OtherFuel1 and OtherFuel2. This is a required field with no default.
```
	
##  Field: Number of Speeds 
NumberOfSpeeds
```
This field specifies the number of sets of data being entered for rated specifications, performance curves, evaporative condenser data, latent degradation data, and waste heat specifications for each cooling speed. The rated specifications consist of gross rated capacity, gross rated SHR, gross rated COP, and rated air flow rate. The performance curves consist of a total capacity modifier curve as a function of temperature, total capacity modifier curve as a function of flow fraction, energy input ratio modifier curve as a function of temperature, energy input ratio modifier curve as a function of flow fraction, and part load fraction correlation as a function of part load ratio. The evaporative condenser data consists of effectiveness, condenser air volume flow rate, and rated pump power consumption. The latent degradation data consists of nominal time for condensate removal to begin, ratio of initial moisture evaporation rate and steady-state latent capacity, maximum On/Off cycling rate, and latent capacity time constant. The latent degradation data are only applied if the supply air fan operation mode is specified as ContinuousFanWithCyclingCompressor. The waste heat specifications include the fraction of energy input to the cooling coil at the fully loaded and rated conditions, and a temperature modifier. The minimum number of speeds for cooling is 2 and the maximum number is 4. The number of speeds should be the same as the number of speeds for cooling defined in its parent object ({AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed} or [unitarysystemperformancemultispeed]{UnitarySystemPerformance:Multispeed} used with {AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem}). The first set of performance inputs is for Speed 1 and should be for low speed, and the last set of performance inputs should be for high speed. For example, if only three cooling speeds are defined, the first set should be for low speed (Speed 1), the second set should be for medium speed (Speed 2), and the third set should be for high speed (Speed 3). In this example, any performance inputs for Speed 4 would be neglected (since this input field specifies that the coil only has three cooling speeds).

The performance for each cooling speed must be specified as shown below. All inputs for Speed 1 are required first, followed by the inputs for Speed 2, Speed 3 and Speed 4.
```
	
##  Field: Speed <x> Gross Rated Total Cooling Capacity 
SpeedXGrossRatedTotalCoolingCapacity
```
The total, full load gross cooling capacity (sensible plus latent) in watts of the DX coil unit for Speed <x> operation at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7°C drybulb/19.4°C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35°C drybulb/23.9°C wetbulb{ux5fftn3}{[3]}, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field Rated Air Flow Rate, Speed <x> below).

##  Field: Speed <x> Total Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name 
SpeedXTotalCoolingCapacityFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the gross total cooling capacity for Speed <x> as a function of the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44°C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35°C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity for Speed <x> to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.
```
	
##  Field: Speed <x> Total Cooling Capacity Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name 
SpeedXTotalCoolingCapacityFunctionOfFlowFractionCurveName
```
The name of a quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the gross total cooling capacity for Speed <x> as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate for Speed <x> (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity for Speed <x> at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate for Speed <x>.
```
	
##  Field: Speed <x> Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name 
SpeedXEnergyInputRatioFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) for Speed <x> as a function of the wetbulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil and the drybulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser (wetbulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44°C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35°C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR for Speed <x> (inverse of rated COP for Speed <x>) to give the EIR for Speed <x> at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures).
```
	
##  Field: Speed <x> Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name 
SpeedXEnergyInputRatioFunctionOfFlowFractionCurveName
```
The name of a quadratic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) for Speed <x> as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate for Speed <x> (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR for Speed <x> at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate for Speed <x>.
```
	
##  Field: Speed <x> Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name 
SpeedXPartLoadFractionCorrelationCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity for Speed <x>). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep for Speed <x>. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.
The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 <= PLR < 1), the following rules apply:
       PLF > = 0.7     and     PLF > = PLR
If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.
A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional DX cooling coil (Speed <x>) would be:
       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)
If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:
       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)
```

Nominal time is equal to the ratio of the energy of the coil's maximum condensate holding capacity (J) to the coil's steady-state latent capacity (W). Suggested value is 1000; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX}) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]), and this field as well as the next three input fields for this object must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation for Speed <x>.

SpeedXMaximumCyclingRate
```
For Speed <x>, the maximum on-off cycling rate for the compressor (cycles per hour), which occurs at 50% run time fraction. Suggested value is 3; zero value means latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX}) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]); and this field, the previous two fields and the next field must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation for Speed <x>.

##  Field: Speed <x> Latent Capacity Time Constant 
SpeedXLatentCapacityTimeConstant
```
For Speed <x>, the time constant (in seconds) for the cooling coil's latent capacity to reach steady state after startup. Suggested value is 45; zero value means latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX}) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]), and this field as well as the previous three input fields for this object must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation for Speed <x>.
```
	
##  Field: Speed <x> Rated Waste Heat Fraction of Power Input 
SpeedXRatedWasteHeatFractionOfPowerInput
```

```
	
##  Field: Speed <x> Waste Heat Function of Temperature Curve Name 
SpeedXWasteHeatFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the waste heat recovery as a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature and the entering coil dry-bulb temperature at Speed <x>. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated waste heat fraction at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point). The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point. When the fuel type is electricity, this field can remain blank since it is ignored by the program in this instance. When the fuel type is not electricity and the parent object {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed} does not require waste heat calculations, this field is ignored. If the field is blank, a warning will be issued and simulation continues. When the fuel type is not electricity and the parent object {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed} requires waste heat calculations, if this field is left blank, the program assumes a constant value of 1 to make simulation continue and a warning will be issued.
```
	
##  Field: Speed <x> Evaporative Condenser Effectiveness 
SpeedXEvaporativeCondenserEffectiveness
```
The effectiveness of the evaporative condenser at Speed <x>, which is used to determine the temperature of the air entering the outdoor condenser coil as follows:
Tcond inlet =  \left( {Twb,o} \right)   +   \left( {1 - EvapCondEffectivenes{s_{Speed1}}} \right)\left( {Tdb,o   - Twb,o} \right)
where
{T_{cond\\ inlet}} = the temperature of the air entering the condenser coil (C)
{T_{wb,o}} = the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)
{T_{db,o}} = the dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)
The resulting condenser inlet air temperature is used by the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve, Speed <x> (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve, Speed <x> (function of temperature). The default value for this field is 0.9, although valid entries can range from 0.0 to 1.0. This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.
If the user wants to model an air-cooled condenser, they should simply specify AirCooled in the field Condenser Type. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve, Speed <x> (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve, Speed <x> (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature.
If the user wishes to model an evaporative-cooled condenser AND they have performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled and the evaporative condenser effectiveness value should be entered as 1.0. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve, Speed <x> (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve, Speed <x> (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil.
If the user wishes to model an air-cooled condenser that has evaporative media placed in front of it to cool the air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled. The user must also enter the appropriate evaporative effectiveness for the media. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve, Speed <x> (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve, Speed <x> (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Be aware that the evaporative media will significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the condenser coil, so the Total Cooling Capacity and EIR Modifier Curves for Speed <x> must be valid for the expected range of dry-bulb temperatures that will be entering the condenser coil.

##  Field: Speed <x> Evaporative Condenser Air Flow Rate 
SpeedXEvaporativeCondenserAirFlowRate

This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.
```
	
##  Field: Speed <x> Rated Evaporative Condenser Pump Power Consumption 
SpeedXRatedEvaporativeCondenserPumpPowerConsumption
```
The rated power of the evaporative condenser water pump in Watts at Speed <x>. This value is used to calculate the power required to pump the water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The default value for this input field is zero, but it is autosizable (equivalent to 0.004266 W per watt [15 W/ton] of rated total capacity for Speed <x>). This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Name for Condenser Placement

# CoilCoolingDXVariableSpeed

`Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed`
```
The Variable-Speed DX Cooling Coil is a collection of performance curves that represent the cooling coil at various speed levels. The performance curves should be generated from a Reference Unit data. This is an equation-fit model that resembles a black box with no usage of heat transfer equations. On the other hand, the model uses the bypass factor approach to calculate sensible heat transfer rate, similar to the one used in the single-speed DX coil. The number of speed levels can range from 1 to 10. The cooling coil has two indoor air side connections, and one optional condenser air node connection. The user needs to specify a nominal speed level, at which the gross rated total cooling capacity, and rated volumetric air rate are sized. The rated capacity and rated volumetric flow rate represent the real situation in the air loop, and are used to determine and flow rates at various speed levels in the parent objects, e.g.~of {AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem}, {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool}, {ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalAirConditioner}, {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir} and {ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump}. It shall be mentioned that the performance correction curves, i.e. the temperature and flow fraction correction curves, should be normalized to the capacity and flow rate at each individual speed and at the rated conditions, similar to the performance curves used in the single-speed DX coil. However, the performance values, e.g.~capacities, COPs, SHRs and flow rates at individual speed levels, should be given regarding a specific unit from the Reference Unit catalog data. In the following content, the statement started with Reference Unit means the actual Reference Unit catalog data. The rated conditions for obtaining the capacities, COPs and SHRs are at indoor dry-bulb temperature of 26.67°C (80°F), wet bulb temperature of 19.44°C (67°F), and the condenser entering air temperature of 35°C (95°F). Some equations are provided below to help explain the function of the various performance curves and data fields.

{\rm{CapacityScaleFactor}} = \frac{{{\rm{Gross RatedTotalCoolingCapacity}}}}{{{\rm{ReferenceUnitCapacity}}@{\rm{NominalSpeedLevel}}}}
And then, this scaling factor is used to determine capacities at rated conditions for other speed levels, as below,
  
    \rm{Gross RatedCapacity} @ \rm{SpeedLevel} \left( {\rm{x}} \right) = \\
    \quad \quad \quad \rm{CapacityScaleFactor} \times \\

```
This numeric field contains the rated volumetric air flow rate on the load side of the DX unit, corresponding to the nominal speed level. This field is autosizable. The value is used to determine an internal scaling factor, and calculate the air flow rates in the parent objects.

##  Field: Nominal Time for Condensate Removal to Begin 
NominalTimeForCondensateRemovalToBegin
```
This numeric field defines the nominal time (in seconds) after startup for condensate to begin leaving the coil's condensate drain line at the coil's rated airflow and temperature conditions, starting with a dry coil.

The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep for Speed 1. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep).
```

If a tank is specified, the unit will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However, if the tank cannot provide all the water the condenser needs, then the unit will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as StarvedWater).
```
	
##  Field: Condensate Collection Water Storage Tank Name 
CondensateCollectionWaterStorageTankName
```
This field is optional. It is used to describe where condensate from the coil is collected. If blank or omitted, then any coil condensate is discarded. Enter the name of Water Storage Tank object defined elsewhere and the condensate will then be collected in that tank.

```
This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the DX coil is off.

# CoilPerformanceDXCooling

`CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling`
```
This coil performance object is used to specify DX coil performance for one mode of operation for a {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode}. A single {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode} object will reference one to four CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling objects depending on the number of available stages and dehumidification modes as specified in the two stage DX object. For example, a standard 2-stage DX system will use two of these performance objects, one to defined the capacity and performance for stage 1 operation, and a second one for stage 1+2 (both stages active) operation. In nearly all cases, the Rated Air Volume Flow Rate will be the same for all performance objects associated with a given multimode DX coil. If bypass is specified, the Rated Air Volume Flow Rate includes both the bypassed flow and the flow through the active coil.
This DX coil model is identical to {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed} with addition of bypass and multi-stage capabilities. This DX cooling coil model and input are quite different from that for the heating and cooling water coils. The simple water coils use an NTU-effectiveness heat exchanger model. The single speed DX coil model uses performance information at rated conditions along with curve fits for variations in total capacity, energy input ratio and part-load fraction to determine performance at part-load conditions. Sensible/latent capacity splits are determined by the rated sensible heat ratio (SHR) and the apparatus dewpoint/bypass factor (ADP/BF) approach. This approach is analogous to the NTU-effectiveness calculations used for sensible-only heat exchanger calculations, extended to a cooling and dehumidifying coil.
An alternative to ADP/BF method for sensible/latent capacity split is to use SHR modifier curves for temperature and flow fraction. These two optional input fields are used only when a user specified SHR calculation method desired over the (ADP/BF) method. Sensible heat ratio calculated using these two SHR modifier curves override the value calculated by ADP/BF method. See section SHR Calculation Using User Specified SHR Modifier Curves in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details.
The DX cooling coil input requires the gross rated total cooling capacity, the gross rated SHR, the gross rated COP, the rated air volume flow rate, and the fraction of air flow which is bypassed around the coil. The first 4 inputs determine the coil performance at the rating point (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7°C drybulb/19.4°C wetbulb and air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35°C drybulb/23.9°C wetbulb). The rated air volume flow rate (less any bypassed fraction) should be between .00004027 m^{3}/s and .00006041 m^{3}/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (300 to 450 cfm/ton). The rated volumetric air flow to gross total cooling capacity ratio for 100% dedicated outdoor air (DOAS) application DX cooling coils should be between 0.00001677 (m3/s)/W (125 cfm/ton) and 0.00003355 (m3/s)/W (250 cfm/ton).
This model requires 5 curves as follows:
  The total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) is a biquadratic curve with two independent variables: wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44°C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35°C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures).
  The total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.
  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) is a biquadratic curve with two independent variables: wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44°C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35°C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures).
  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.
  The part load fraction correlation (function of part load ratio) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being part load ratio (sensible cooling load / steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The curve should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep).
The curves are simply specified by name. Curve inputs are described in the curve manager section of this document (see Performance Curves in this document).
The next four input fields are optional and relate to the degradation of latent cooling capacity when the supply air fan operates continuously while the cooling coil/compressor cycle on and off to meet the cooling load. The fan operating mode is either considered to be constant (e.g.~{CoilSystem:Cooling:DX}) or can be scheduled in the parent object (e.g.~{AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool}). When scheduled, the schedule value must be greater than 0 to calculate degradation of latent cooling capacity. At times when the parent object's supply air fan operating mode schedule is 0, latent degradation will be ignored. When used, these next four input fields must all have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.
The next input specifies the outdoor air node used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must be listed in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name must be specified in an {OutdoorAir:NodeList} object where the outdoor temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data. This field may also be left blank, if this is the case then the outdoor temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data.
The next input describes the type of outdoor condenser coil used with the DX cooling coil (Air Cooled or Evap Cooled). The following three inputs are required when modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser: evaporative condenser effectiveness, evaporative condenser air volume flow rate, and the power consumed by the evaporative condenser pump. See section DX Cooling Coil Model in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details regarding this model.

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field is a unique user-assigned name for an instance of DX cooling coil performance. Any reference to this DX coil performance object by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Gross Rated Total Cooling Capacity 
GrossRatedTotalCoolingCapacity
```
The total, full load gross cooling capacity (sensible plus latent) in watts of the DX coil unit at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7°C drybulb/19.4°C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35°C drybulb/23.9°C wetbulb{ux5fftn4}{[4]}, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field rated air flow rate below). Capacity should be gross (i.e., the effect of supply air fan heat is NOT accounted for).
```
	
##  Field: Gross Rated Sensible Heat Ratio 
GrossRatedSensibleHeatRatio
```
The sensible heat ratio (SHR = gross sensible capacity divided by gross total cooling capacity) of the DX cooling coil at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7°C drybulb/19.4°C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35°C drybulb/23.9°C wetbulb, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field rated air flow rate below). Both the sensible and total cooling capacities used to define the Rated SHR should be gross (i.e., the effect of supply air fan heat is NOT accounted for).
```
	
##  Field: Gross Rated Cooling COP 
GrossRatedCoolingCOP
```
The coefficient of performance is the ratio of the gross total cooling capacity in watts to electrical power input in watts) of the DX cooling coil unit at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7°C drybulb/19.4°C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35°C drybulb/ 23.9°C wetbulb, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field rated air flow rate below). The input power includes electric power for the compressor(s) and condenser fan(s) but does not include the power consumption of the supply air fan. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 3.0.
```
	
##  Field: Rated Air Flow Rate 
RatedAirFlowRate
```
The air volume flow rate, in {\volumeFlowRate}, across the DX cooling coil at rated conditions. The gross rated total cooling capacity, gross rated SHR and gross rated COP should be performance information for the unit with air entering the cooling coil at 26.7°C drybulb/19.4°C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35°C drybulb/23.9°C wetbulb, and the rated air volume flow rate defined here.
```
	
##  Field: Fraction of Air Flow Bypassed Around Coil 
FractionOfAirFlowBypassedAroundCoil
```
This numeric field specifies the fraction of the Rated Air Volume Flow Rate which bypasses the active cooling coil for this performance mode. The remaining portion of the flow should be between 0.00004027 m3/s and .00006041 m3/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (300 to 450 cfm/ton) for this performance mode. For DOAS applications the remaining portion of rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00001677 m^{3}/s and 0.00003355 m^{3}/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (125 to 250 cfm/ton). This is used to model face-split coils on multi-stage units or bypass dampers. If total flow rate varies during simulation, the same fraction is bypassed. This input may range from 0.0 to <1.0. The default is 0.0. For a multi-stage face-split coil in which stage 1 is 60% of total capacity, this field would be set to 0.4 for the Stage 1 performance and set to 0.0 for the Stage 1+2 performance. For a DX system which activates a bypass damper for improved dehumidification, this field would be set to 0.0 for normal mode performance and set to something greater than zero for enhanced dehumidification mode performance.
```

The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.
```
	
##  Field: Total Cooling Capacity Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name 
TotalCoolingCapacityFunctionOfFlowFractionCurveName
```
The name of a {quadratic} or {cubic} performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the gross total cooling capacity as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.

##  Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name 
EnergyInputRatioFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
The name of a {biquadratic} performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point.
```
	
##  Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name 
EnergyInputRatioFunctionOfFlowFractionCurveName
```
The name of a {quadratic} or {cubic} performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.
```
	
##  Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name 
PartLoadFractionCorrelationCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a {quadratic} or {cubic} performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.
The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 <= PLR < 1), the following rules apply:
PLF >= 0.7 and PLF >= PLR
If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.
A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:
       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)
If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:
       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)
```
	
##  Field: Nominal Time for Condensate Removal to Begin 
NominalTimeForCondensateRemovalToBegin
```
The nominal time (in seconds) after startup for condensate to begin leaving the coil's condensate drain line at the coil's rated airflow and temperature conditions, starting with a dry coil. Nominal time is equal to the ratio of the energy of the coil's maximum condensate holding capacity (J) to the coil's steady-state latent capacity (W). Suggested value is 1000; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX}) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]), and this field as well as the next three input fields for this object must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.
```
	
##  Field: Ratio of Initial Moisture Evaporation Rate and Steady State Latent Capacity 
RatioOfInitialMoistureEvaporationRateAndSteadyStateLatentCapacity
```
Ratio of the initial moisture evaporation rate from the cooling coil (when the compressor first turns off, in Watts) and the coil's steady-state latent capacity (Watts) at rated airflow and temperature conditions. Suggested value is 1.5; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX}) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]); and this field, the previous field and the next two fields must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Cycling Rate 
MaximumCyclingRate
```
The maximum on-off cycling rate for the compressor (cycles per hour), which occurs at 50% run time fraction. Suggested value is 3; zero value means latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX}) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]); and this field, the previous two fields and the next field must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.
```
	
##  Field: Latent Capacity Time Constant 
LatentCapacityTimeConstant
```
Time constant (in seconds) for the cooling coil's latent capacity to reach steady state after startup. Suggested value is 45; zero value means latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other parent objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX}) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]), and this field as well as the previous three input fields for this object must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Air Inlet Node Name 
CondenserAirInletNodeName
```
This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air temperature entering the condenser (dry-bulb or wet-bulb) is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an {OutdoorAir:NodeList} object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Type 
CondenserType
```
The type of condenser used by the DX cooling coil. Valid choices for this input field are {AirCooled} or {EvaporativelyCooled}. The default for this field is {AirCooled}.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporative Condenser Effectiveness 
EvaporativeCondenserEffectiveness
```
The effectiveness of the evaporative condenser, which is used to determine the temperature of the air entering the outdoor condenser coil as follows:
Tcond inlet =  \left( {Twb,o} \right)   +   \left( {1 - EvapCondEffectiveness} \right)\left( {Tdb,o   - Twb,o} \right)
where
{T_{cond\\ inlet}} = the temperature of the air entering the condenser coil (C)
{T_{wb,o}} = the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)
{T_{db,o}} = the dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)
The resulting condenser inlet air temperature is used by the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature). The default value for this field is 0.9, although valid entries can range from 0.0 to 1.0. This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.
If the user wants to model an air-cooled condenser, they should simply specify AirCooled in the field Condenser Type. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature.
If the user wishes to model an evaporative-cooled condenser AND they have performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled and the evaporative condenser effectiveness value should be entered as 1.0. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil.
If the user wishes to model an air-cooled condenser that has evaporative media placed in front of it to cool the air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled. The user must also enter the appropriate evaporative effectiveness for the media. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Be aware that the evaporative media will significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the condenser coil, so the Total Cooling Capacity and EIR Modifier Curves must be valid for the expected range of dry-bulb temperatures that will be entering the condenser coil.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporative Condenser Air Flow Rate 
EvaporativeCondenserAirFlowRate
```
The air volume flow rate, in {\volumeFlowRate}, entering the evaporative condenser. This value is used to calculate the amount of water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The minimum value for this field must be greater than zero, and this input field is autosizable (equivalent to 0.000144 m^{3}/s per watt of rated total cooling capacity [850 cfm/ton]). This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporative Condenser Pump Rated Power Consumption 
EvaporativeCondenserPumpRatedPowerConsumption
```
The rated power of the evaporative condenser water pump in Watts. This value is used to calculate the power required to pump the water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The default value for this input field is zero, but it is autosizable (equivalent to 0.004266 W per watt [15 W/ton] of rated total cooling capacity). This field is not used when Condenser Type = AirCooled.
```
	
##  Field: Sensible Heat Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name 
SensibleHeatRatioFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
The name of a biquadratic normalized curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the sensible heat ratio (SHR) as a function of DX cooling coil entering air wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated SHR and the SHR modifier curve (function of flow fraction) to give the SHR at the specific coil entering air temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rated condition. This input field is optional.
```
	
##  Field: Sensible Heat Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name 
SensibleHeatRatioFunctionOfFlowFractionCurveName
```
The name of a quadratic or cubic normalized curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the sensible heat ratio (SHR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated SHR and the SHR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the SHR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. This input field is optional.

# CoilHeatingDXSingleSpeed

`Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed`
```
The single speed heating DX coil model uses performance information at rated conditions along with curve fits for variations in total capacity, energy input ratio and part load fraction to determine performance at part-load conditions. The impacts of various defrost strategies (reverse cycle, resistive, timed or on-demand) are modeled based on a combination of user inputs and empirical models taken from the air-to-air heat pump algorithms in DOE-2.1E.
The single speed heating DX coil input requires an availability schedule, the gross rated heating capacity, the gross rated COP and the rated air volume flow rate. The latter 3 inputs determine the coil performance at the rating point (outdoor air dry-bulb temperature of 8.33°C, outdoor air wet-bulb temperature of 6.11°C, coil entering air dry-bulb temperature of 21.11°C, coil entering air wet-bulb temperature of 15.55°C). The rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00004027 m^{3}/s and 0.00006041 m^{3}/s per watt of gross rated heating capacity.
Up to 6 curves are required depending on the defrost strategy selected.
  The heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperature or only the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature. User has the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a quadratic curve as well as a cubic curve with a single independent variable. The curve is normalized to 1 at 8.33 outdoor dry-bulb temperature and if a biquadratic curve is used also at 21.11 C indoor dry-bulb temperature. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity to give the gross heating capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature).
  The heating capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity and the heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross heating capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.
  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperature or only the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature. User has the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a quadratic curve as well as a cubic curve with a single independent variable. The curve is normalized to 1 at 8.33 outdoor dry-bulb temperature and if a biquadratic curve is used also at 21.11 C indoor dry-bulb temperature. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature).
  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.
  The part load fraction correlation (function of part load ratio) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being part load ratio (sensible heating load / steady-state heating capacity). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.
  The defrost energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) is a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables: the heating coil entering air wet-bulb temperature (variable x) and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (variable y). The output of this curve is multiplied by the heating coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the coil is operating. This curve is only required when a reverse-cycle defrost strategy is specified.
The curves are simply specified by name. Curve inputs are described in the curve manager section of this document (ref. Performance Curves).
The next input item for the coil is the supply air fan operation mode. Either the supply air fan runs continuously while the DX coil cycles on/off, or the fan and coil cycle on/off together. The next two inputs define the minimum outdoor dry-bulb temperature that the heat pump compressor will operate and the maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature for defrost operation. Crankcase heater capacity and cutout temperature are entered in the following two inputs. The final four inputs cover the type of defrost strategy (reverse-cycle or resistive), defrost control (timed or on-demand), the fractional defrost time period (timed defrost control only), and the resistive defrost heater capacity if a resistive defrost strategy is selected.

##  Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name

The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.

##  Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name 
PartLoadFractionCorrelationCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.
The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 <= PLR < 1), the following rules apply:
PLF >= 0.7 and PLF >= PLR
If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.
A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:
       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)
If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:
       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)

The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the indoor and outdoor coils are operating. This curve is only required when a reverse-cycle defrost strategy is selected. The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point conditions.

# CoilHeatingDXMultiSpeed

`Coil:Heating:DX:MultiSpeed`
```
This component models a DX heating unit with multiple discrete levels of heating capacity. Currently, this heating coil can only be referenced by a {AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem} or {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed} compound object. The multispeed DX heating coil can have from two to four operating speeds. When the coil operates at Speed 1 (the lowest speed), its performance is very similar to the {Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed} object where the impacts of part-load ratio can be included. When the coil operates at higher speeds (above Speed 1), the linear approximation methodology is applied. The coil outputs at two consecutive speeds are linearly interpolated to meet the required heating capacity during an HVAC system timestep. When the coil performs above the lowest speed, the user can choose if they want to include part-load ratio impacts at the higher speeds.
The multispeed unit is described by specifying the performance at different operating speeds. Each speed has its own set of input specifications: full load capacity, COP and air flow rate at rated conditions, along with modifier curves to determine performance when actual operating conditions are different from the rated conditions.
The coil operates to meet the sensible capacity being requested. When this requested capacity is above the sensible capacity of the highest operating speed, the coil runs continuously at the highest speed. When the requested capacity is between the sensible capacities of two consecutive speeds, the unit will operate a portion of the time at each speed to meet the request. When the requested capacity is less than the low speed (Speed 1) capacity, the unit will cycle on/off as needed.
The next input defines the minimum outdoor dry-bulb temperature where the compressor will operate. The followed two inputs are related to crankcase heater operation: capacity and maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature for crankcase heater operation. The next six inputs cover defrost operation: defrost EIR modifier curve, the maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature for defrost operation, the type of defrost strategy (reverse-cycle or resistive), defrost control (timed or on-demand), the fractional defrost time period (timed defrost control only), and the resistive defrost heater capacity if a resistive defrost strategy is selected. The activation of defrost is dependent on outdoor conditions. The capacity reduction and energy use modification are independent of speed. The defrost EIR modifier is described below:
The defrost energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) is a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables: the heating coil entering air wet-bulb temperature (variable x) and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (variable y). The output of this curve is multiplied by the heating coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the coil is operating. This curve is only required when a reverse-cycle defrost strategy is specified.
The next input allows the user to choose whether to apply the part load fraction correlation to speeds greater than 1 or not. The following input is the type of fuel.
Then the number of speed for heating is entered. The rest of inputs are speed dependent. Each set of data consists of gross rated heating capacity, gross rated COP, and the rated air volume flow rate. These three inputs determine the coil performance at the rating point (outdoor air dry-bulb temperature of 8.33°C, outdoor air wet-bulb temperature of 6.11°C, coil entering air dry-bulb temperature of 21.11°C, coil entering air wet-bulb temperature of 15.55°C). The rated air volume flow rate should be between .00004027 m^{3}/s and .00006041 m^{3}/s per watt of gross rated heating capacity. The rated waste heat fraction is needed to calculate how much waste heat is available at the rated conditions. In addition, up to 6 modifier curves are required per speed.
  The heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperature or only the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature. User has the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a quadratic curve as well as a cubic curve with a single independent variable. The curve is normalized to 1 at 8.33 outdoor dry-bulb temperature and if a biquadratic curve is used also at 21.11 C indoor dry-bulb temperature. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity to give the gross total heating capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature).
  The heating capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity and the heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross heating capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.
  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperature or only the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature. User has the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a quadratic curve as well as a cubic curve with a single independent variable. The curve is normalized to 1 at 8.33 outdoor dry-bulb temperature and if a biquadratic curve is used also at 21.11 C indoor dry-bulb temperature. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature).
  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.
  The part load fraction correlation (function of part load ratio) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being part load ratio (sensible heating load / steady-state heating capacity). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.
  The waste heat modifier curve (function of temperature) is a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables: outdoor air dry-bulb temperature and the heating coil entering air dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the heating input energy, the waste heat fraction of heat input to give the recoverable waste heat.
The curves are simply specified by name. Curve inputs are described in the curve manager section of this document (ref. Performance Curves).

##  Field: Defrost Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name 
DefrostEnergyInputRatioFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) during reverse-cycle defrost periods as a function of the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor coil (variable x) and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (variable y). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the indoor and outdoor coils are operating. This curve is only required when a reverse-cycle defrost strategy is selected. The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point conditions.
```

```
	
##  Field: Defrost Strategy 
DefrostStrategy
```
This alpha field has two choices: reverse-cycle or resistive. If the reverse-cycle strategy is selected, the heating cycle is reversed periodically to provide heat to melt frost accumulated on the outdoor coil. If a resistive defrost strategy is selected, the frost is melted using an electric resistance heater. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost strategy is reverse-cycle.
```
	
##  Field: Defrost Control 
DefrostControl
```
This alpha field has two choices: timed or on-demand. If timed control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on a fixed value or compressor runtime whether or not frost has actually accumulated. For timed defrost control, the fractional amount of time the unit is in defrost is entered in the input field Defrost Time Period Fraction described below. If on-demand defrost control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on outdoor weather (humidity ratio) conditions. Regardless of which defrost control is selected, defrost does not occur above the user specified outdoor temperature entered in the input field Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation described above. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost control is timed.
```
	
##  Field: Defrost Time Period Fraction 
DefrostTimePeriodFraction
```
This numeric field defines the fraction of compressor runtime when the defrost cycle is active, and only applies to timed defrost (see Defrost Control input field above). For example, if the defrost cycle is active for 3.5 minutes for every 60 minutes of compressor runtime, then the user should enter 3.5/60 = 0.058333. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.058333.
```

```
	
##  Field: Apply Part Load Fraction to Speeds Greater than 1 
ApplyPartLoadFractionToSpeedsGreaterThan1
```
This field determines whether part-load impacts on coil energy use are applied when the coil is operating at speeds greater than speed 1. The allowed choices are Yes or No, with the default being No if this field is left blank. Other input fields in this object allow the user to specify a part-load fraction correlation for each speed to account for compressor start up losses (cycle on/off). For the case of a single multi-speed compressor, the part load losses may only be significant when the compressor cycles between speed 1 and off, but the losses may be extremely small when the compressor operates between speed 1 and speed 2 (or between speeds 2 and 3, etc.). In this case, the user may chose to specify {No} for this input field to neglect part-load impacts on energy use at higher operating speeds. If part-load impacts on coil energy use are thought to be significant (e.g., interwined cooling coil with multiple compressors feeding individual refrigerant circuits), then the user may chose to specify {Yes} and the part-load fraction correlations specified for speeds 2 through 4 will be applied as appropriate. The selection for this input field does not affect part-load impacts when the compressor cycles between speed 1 and off (i.e., the part-load fraction correlation for speed 1 is always applied).
```
	
##  Field: Fuel Type 
FuelType
```
This alpha field determines the type of fuel that the chiller uses. This field has seven choices: Electricity, NaturalGas, Propane, Coal, Diesel, Gasoline, FuelOilNo1, FuelOilNo2, OtherFuel1 and OtherFuel2. This is a required field with no default.
```
	
##  Field: Number of Speeds 
NumberOfSpeeds
```
This field specifies the number of sets of data being entered for rated specifications, performance curves, and waste heat specifications for each cooling speed. The rated specifications consist of gross rated capacity, gross rated COP, and rated air flow rate. The performance curves consist of a total capacity modifier curve as a function of temperature, total capacity modifier curve as a function of flow fraction, energy input ratio modifier curve as a function of temperature, energy input ratio modifier curve as a function of flow fraction, and part load fraction correlation as a function of part load ratio. The waste heat specifications include the fraction of energy input to the heating coil at the fully loaded and rated conditions, and a temperature modifier. The minimum number of speeds for heating is 2 and the maximum number is 4. The number of speeds should be the same as the number of speeds for heating defined in its parent object ({AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed}). The first set of performance inputs is for Speed 1 and should be for low speed, and the last set of performance inputs should be for high speed. For example, if only three heating speeds are defined, the first set should be for low speed (Speed 1), the second set should be for medium speed (Speed 2), and the third set should be for high speed (Speed 3). In this example, any performance inputs for Speed 4 would be neglected (since this input field specifies that the coil only has three heating speeds).

##  Field: Speed <x> Heating Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name 
SpeedXHeatingCapacityFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```

This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve for Speed <x> (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of heating capacity as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity and the gross heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross heating capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.
```
	
##  Field: Speed <x> Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name

The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an indoor air dry-bulb temperature or outdoor air dry-bulb temperature different from the rating point temperature). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.
```
	
##  Field: Speed <x> Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name 
SpeedXEnergyInputRatioFunctionOfFlowFractionCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve for Speed <x> (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.
```
	
##  Field: Speed <x>Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name 
SpeedXPartLoadFractionCorrelationCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve for Speed <x> (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.
The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 <= PLR < 1), the following rules apply:
       PLF > = 0.7     and     PLF > = PLR
If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.
A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional DX heating coil (Speed <x>) would be:
       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)
If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:
       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)

##  Field: Speed <x> Waste Heat Function of Temperature Curve Name 
SpeedXWasteHeatFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName

The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated recoverable waste heat at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point). The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point. When the fuel type is electricity, the field is either left blank or ignored by the program. When the fuel type is not electricity and the parent object {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed} does not require waste heat calculations, this field is ignored. If the field is blank, a warning will be issued and simulation continues. When the fuel type is not electricity and the parent object {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed} requires waste heat calculations, if this field is left blank, the program assumes a constant value of 1 to make simulation continue and a warning will be issued.

# CoilHeatingDXVariableSpeed

`Coil:Heating:DX:VariableSpeed`
```
The Variable-Speed Air-to-Air Heating DX Coil is a collection of performance curves that represent the heating coil at various speed levels. The performance curves should be generated from the heat pump Reference Unit catalog data. This is an equation-fit model that resembles a black box with no usage of heat transfer equations. The number of speed levels can range from 1 to 10. The heating coil has two air side node connections. The user needs to specify a nominal speed level, at which the gross rated capacity and rated volumetric air flow rate are sized. The gross rated capacity and rated volumetric flow rate represent the real situation in the air loop, and are used to determine the flow rates at various speed levels in the parent objects, e.g.~{AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem} or {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir}, {ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump}, etc. It shall be mentioned that the performance correction curves, i.e. the temperature and flow fraction correction curves, should be normalized to the capacity and flow rate at each individual speed and at the rated operating conditions, similar to the performance curves used in the single-speed DX coil. On the other hand, the performance values at individual speed levels, e.g.~capacities, COPs and flow rates, should be given regarding a specific unit from the Reference Unit catalog data. In the following content, the statement started with Reference Unit means the actual Reference Unit catalog data. The rated conditions for obtaining the capacities and COPs are at indoor dry-bulb temperature of 21.1°C (70°F) and the source side entering air temperature of 8.3°C (47°F). Some equations are provided below to help explain the function of the various performance curves and data fields.

```
	
##  Field: Number of Speeds 
NumberOfSpeeds
```
This numeric field contains the maximum number of speed levels that the module uses. The number of speeds, for which the user input the performance data and curves, has to be equal to or higher than the maximum number. The performance inputs at higher speeds are ignored.
```
	
##  Field: Nominal Speed Level 
NominalSpeedLevel
```
This numeric field defines the nominal speed level, at which the rated capacity, rated air and volumetric flow rate are correlated.
```
	
##  Field: Gross Rated Heating Capacity at Selected Nominal Speed Level 
GrossRatedHeatingCapacityAtSelectedNominalSpeedLevel
```
This numeric field contains the rated capacity at the nominal speed level. This field is autosizable. The gross rated heating capacity is used to determine a capacity scaling factor, as compared to the Reference Unit capacity at the nominal speed level.
\rm{CapacityScaleFactor} = \frac{{{\rm{Gross RatedTotalHeatingCapacity}}}}{{{\rm{ReferenceUnitCapacity}}@{\rm{NominalSpeedLevel}}}}
And then, this scaling factor is used to determine capacities at rated conditions for other speed levels, as below,
  
    \rm{Gross RatedCapacity} @ \rm{SpeedLevel} \left( \rm{x} \right) = \\
    \quad \quad \quad \rm{CapacityScaleFactor} \times \\
    \quad \quad \quad \rm{ReferenceUnitCapacity} @ \rm{SpeedLevel}(\rm{x})
```
	
##  Field: Rated Volumetric Air Flow Rate 
RatedVolumetricAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the rated volumetric air flow rate on the load side of the heat pump corresponding to the nominal speed level. This field is autosizable. The value is used to determine an internal scaling factor, and calculate the air flow rates in the parent objects. It is recommended that the ratio of the rated volumetric air flow rate to the rated capacity is the same as the unit performance from the Reference Unit data.
{\rm{AirFlowScaleFactor}} = \frac{{{\rm{RatedVolumetricAirFlowRate}}}}{{{\rm{ReferenceUnitVolAirFlowRate}}@{\rm{NominalSpeedLevel}} \times {\rm{CapacityScaleFactor}}}}
And the volumetric air flow rates in the parent objects are calculated as below,
  
    {\rm{LoopVolumetricAirFlowRate}}@{\rm{SpeedLevel}}left( {\rm{x}} \right) = \\
    \quad \quad \quad {\rm{AirFlowScaleFactor}} \times \\
    \quad \quad \quad {\rm{ReferenceUnitVolAirFlowRate}}@{\rm{SpeedLevel}}({\rm{x}}) \times \\
    \quad {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} \quad \quad {\rm{CapacityScaleFactor}}
```
	
##  Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name 
PartLoadFractionCorrelationCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, heating load/steady-state heating capacity for Speed 1), in the case that the unit operates under the lowest speed, i.e.~on/off. The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep for Speed 1. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep).
```
	
##  Field: Defrost Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name 
DefrostEnergyInputRatioFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName

This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) during reverse-cycle defrost periods as a function of the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor coil (variable x) and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (variable y). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the coil capacity at the maximum speed level, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the indoor and outdoor coils are operating. This curve is only required when a reverse cycle defrost strategy is selected. The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point conditions.

```
	
##  Field: Defrost Strategy 
DefrostStrategy
```
This alpha field has two choices: reverse-cycle or resistive. If the reverse-cycle strategy is selected, the heating cycle is reversed periodically to provide heat to melt frost accumulated on the outdoor coil. If a resistive defrost strategy is selected, the frost is melted using an electric resistance heater. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost strategy is reverse cycle.
```
	
##  Field: Defrost Control 
DefrostControl
```
This alpha field has two choices: timed or on-demand. If timed control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on a fixed value or compressor runtime whether or not frost has actually accumulated. For timed defrost control, the fractional amount of time the unit is in defrost is entered in the input field Defrost Time Period Fraction described below. If on-demand defrost control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on outdoor weather (humidity ratio) conditions. Regardless of which defrost control is selected, defrost does not occur above the user specified outdoor temperature entered in the input field Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation described above. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost control is timed.
```
	
##  Field: Defrost Time Period Fraction 
DefrostTimePeriodFraction
```
This numeric field defines the fraction of compressor runtime when the defrost cycle is active, and only applies to timed defrost (see Defrost Control input field above). For example, if the defrost cycle is active for 3.5 minutes for every 60 minutes of compressor runtime, then the user should enter 3.5/60 = 0.058333. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.058333.
```

# CoilWaterHeatingDesuperheater

`Coil:WaterHeating:Desuperheater`
```
A simplified approach is used to determine the performance of this water heating coil. The model assumes that the heating energy provided by this coil is reclaimed from the superheated refrigerant gas leaving a compressor (i.e., a desuperheating refrigerant-to-water heating coil) and does not impact the performance of the compressor. This coil must be used with a water heater tank (e.g., {WaterHeater:Mixed}) which can supply heated potable water and/or hot water for use in a plant loop (e.g., hydronic air reheat coils).
Except for detailed refrigeration system models, the amount of available superheat is simply a percentage of the total heat being rejected by the DX system's condenser. Approximately 25-30% of the energy rejected by typical refrigeration system condensers is to reduce the superheated refrigerant vapor temperature to the condensing temperature. Recovery efficiencies higher than 30% may cause the refrigerant gas to condense which in turn impacts the performance of the refrigeration system. For this reason, the maximum heat reclaim recovery efficiency for this coil is 30% for most sources of waste heat, including refrigeration compressor racks. The one exception to this 30% limit is a condenser that is part of a detailed refrigeration system. In a detailed refrigeration system, the portion of the rejected heat that lies within the superheated region is explicitly calculated. Therefore, the desuperheater coils supplied by a condenser attached to a detailed refrigeration system are subject to a maximum reclaim recovery efficiency of 90% of the heat within the superheated region.
The model includes the ability to modify the heat reclaim recovery efficiency based on variations in inlet water temperature and outdoor air dry-bulb temperature.
This coil model performs the following major functions:
  calculates the amount of heat delivered to the water tank
  calculates the electricity consumption of the integral water pump and on/off-cycle parasitic loads
  reflects the reduction of heat transfer in the HVAC condenser plant loop if the source coil is water-cooled
The input fields for this object are described below in detail:
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field contains a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a desuperheater water heating coil. Any reference to this desuperheater coil by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the desuperheater coil is available to operate during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the desuperheater coil is off for that time period. A value other than 0 denotes that the desuperheater coil is available to operate during that time period. During times when the desuperheater coil is scheduled off, the heater (element or burner) in the water tank object operates based on its tank set point temperature schedule and the desuperheater coil's parasitic electric power is also off for that time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name 
SetpointTemperatureScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that specifies the set point (or cut-out ) temperature for the desuperheater coil. Temperature values used in this schedule should be in degrees Celsius. The desuperheater coil turns off when the tank water reaches this set point temperature. Once the desuperheater coil is off, the tank water temperature floats downward until it falls below the set point temperature minus the dead band temperature difference defined below (i.e., the cut-in temperature). At this point, the desuperheater coil turns on and remains on until the desuperheater coil set point temperature is reached.
```
	
##  Field: Dead Band Temperature Difference 
DeadBandTemperatureDifference
```
This numeric field contains the dead band temperature difference in degrees Celsius. The desuperheater coil cut-in temperature is defined as the desuperheater coil set point temperature defined above minus this dead band temperature difference. The desuperheater coil turns on when the water temperature in the tank falls below the cut-in temperature. The desuperheater coil remains on until the water temperature in the tank rises above the desuperheater coil set point ( cut-out ) temperature defined above. The dead band temperature difference must be greater than 0°C and less than or equal to 20°C. If this field is left blank, the default value is 5°C.
Desuperheater water heating coils are typically used to offset energy consumption by the water tank's heater (element or burner). Therefore, the cut-in temperature for the desuperheater coil (set point minus dead band temperature difference) is usually higher than the set point temperature for the heater (element or burner) in the associated water heater tank object. At times when the water heater tank set point temperature is greater than the cut-in temperature of the desuperheater coil, the model disables the desuperheater coil and the tank's heater is used to heat the water.
```
	
##  Field: Rated Heat Reclaim Recovery Efficiency 
RatedHeatReclaimRecoveryEfficiency
```
This numeric field defines the ratio of recovered waste heat from the superheated refrigerant gas to the total rejected waste heat from the heating source (as if no heat reclaim occurred). Input values must be greater than 0 up to a maximum value is 0.3 (with a defaults of 0.25) for most sources of waste heat, including refrigeration compressor racks. The one exception to this 0.3 limit is a source that is a condenser that is part of a detailed refrigeration system. In a detailed refrigeration system, the portion of the rejected heat that lies within the superheated region is explicitly calculated. Therefore, the desuperheater coils supplied by a condenser attached to a detailed refrigeration system are subject to a maximum reclaim recovery efficiency of 0.9. with a default value is 0.8.
```
	
##  Field: Rated Inlet Water Temperature 
RatedInletWaterTemperature
```
This numeric field defines the coil inlet water temperature, in degrees Celsius, that corresponds to the rated heat reclaim recovery efficiency. Also see field Heat Reclaim Efficiency Modifier Curve Name (function of temperature) below.
```
	
##  Field: Rated Outdoor Air Temperature 
RatedOutdoorAirTemperature
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature, in degrees Celsius, that corresponds to the rated heat reclaim recovery efficiency. The outdoor air dry-bulb temperature impacts the desuperheater coil refrigerant temperature and the amount of heat available for reclaim. Also see field Heat Reclaim Efficiency Modifier Curve Name(function of temperature) below.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Inlet Water Temperature for Heat Reclaim 
MaximumInletWaterTemperatureForHeatReclaim
```
This numeric field defines the maximum coil inlet water temperature in degrees Celsius. Any time the inlet water temperature to the desuperheater coil is above this maximum allowed temperature, heat reclaim is restricted so that the tank water does not exceed this temperature.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Reclaim Efficiency Function of Temperature Curve Name 
HeatReclaimEfficiencyFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
This alpha field specifies the name of a bi-quadratic curve object (ref: Performance Curves) that defines the variation in heat reclaim efficiency as a function of inlet fluid (air and water) temperatures. The bi-quadratic curve uses the coil inlet water temperature and outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (entering the DX coil condenser) as the independent variables. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated heat reclaim recovery efficiency to give the heat reclaim efficiency at specific operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point temperatures. If this field is left blank, the heat reclaim efficiency remains constant (curve value assumed to be 1.0 for all conditions). The model restricts the product of the output of this curve and the rated heat reclaim recovery efficiency to a maximum of 0.9 for refrigeration condenser sources and 0.3 for all other sources..
```
	
##  Field: Water Inlet Node Name 
WaterInletNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the water node from which the desuperheater heating coil draws its inlet water. This node name must also match the source side outlet node name for the water heater tank used with this coil (ref. Water Heaters).
```
	
##  Field: Water Outlet Node Name 
WaterOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the water node to which the desuperheater heating coil sends its outlet water. This node name must also match the source side inlet node name for the water heater tank used with this coil (ref. Water Heaters).
```
	
##  Field: Tank Object Type 
TankObjectType
```
This alpha (choice) field contains the types of water heater tank used by this desuperheater heating coil. The valid choices are:
 {WaterHeater:Mixed}
 {WaterHeater:Stratified}
```
	
##  Field: Tank Name 
TankName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the specific water heater tank ({WaterHeater:Mixed} or {WaterHeater:Stratified} object) used by this desuperheater heating coil.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Source Object Type 
HeatingSourceObjectType
```
This alpha (choice) field defines the source of superheated refrigerant gas from which the desuperheater water heating coil recovers energy through heat reclaim. Valid choices are:
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed}
  {Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit}
  {Refrigeration:CompressorRack}
  {Refrigeration:Condenser:AirCooled}
  {Refrigeration:Condenser:EvaporativeCooled}
  {Refrigeration:Condenser:WaterCooled}
```
	
##  Field: Heating Source Name 
HeatingSourceName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the desuperheater coil's heat source (e.g., the name of a specific coil of the type mentioned in the previous field which provides waste heat to this desuperheater water heating coil).
```
	
##  Field: Water Flow Rate 
WaterFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the desuperheater coil's water flow rate in cubic meters per second. The model assumes that this flow rate is constant (throughout the simulation period) when the desuperheater coil operates, and that it corresponds to the heat reclaim recovery efficiency performance specified by the user. This water flow rate must be greater than zero.
```
	
##  Field: Water Pump Power 
WaterPumpPower
```
This numeric field defines the coil's water circulation pump power in Watts. This is the operating pump power as installed. Values must be greater than or equal to 0. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0. A warning message will be issued if the ratio of water pump power to desuperheater water volumetric flow rate exceeds 7.9264E6 W/m^{3}/s, but the simulation will continue using the user-defined values. The model assumes that this integral pump (i.e., no need to define a separate pump object) cycles on and off with the desuperheater heating coil.
```
	
##  Field: Fraction of Pump Heat to Water 
FractionOfPumpHeatToWater
```
This numeric field defines the fraction of water circulation pump heat that is transferred to the water. The pump is assumed to be downstream of the desuperheater water heating coil, and this field is used to determine the desuperheater water outlet temperature. Values must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.2.
```
	
##  Field: On-Cycle Parasitic Electric Load 
OnCycleParasiticElectricLoad
```
This optional numeric field contains the on-cycle parasitic electric power in Watts. This is the parasitic electric power consumed by controls or other electrical devices associated with the desuperheater water heating coil. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the desuperheater coil is operating, and the model assumes that this parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water nor does it affect the zone air heat balance. The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Off-Cycle Parasitic Electric Load 
OffCycleParasiticElectricLoad
```
This optional numeric field contains the off-cycle parasitic electric power in Watts. This is the parasitic electric power consumed by controls or other electrical devices associated with the desuperheater water heating coil. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the desuperheater coil is available but is not operating, and the model assumes that this parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water nor does it affect the zone air heat balance. The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if this field is left blank.

# CoilSystemCoolingDX

`CoilSystem:Cooling:DX`
```
The CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object is a virtual container component that consists of a DX cooling coil component and its associated controls, as shown in the Figure below. This control object supports several different types of DX cooling coils (see field Cooling Coil Object Type).
This component may be used as a cooling coil in constant volume or variable volume systems, as blow through or draw through, with or without humidity controls. Unlike AirLoopHVAC:Unitary system types, this component controls only the DX coil, not the supply fan. CoilSystem:Cooling:DX is added to a system by placing it in an air loop branch (see Branch object) or in an {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList} or in a {ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit:EquipmentList} . It requires one or more setpoint manager (see SetpointManager:*) objects to specify temperature and/or humidity setpoints (unless it is used in a {ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit} which has its own temperature setpoints). This object is the one that is listed in the Branch or equipment list object rather than the coil itself. A constant volume or variable volume fan is modeled separately from this cooling system. These are the only fan types allowed for this system type (ref. {Fan:ConstantVolume} and {Fan:VariableVolume}). Cycling fan operation is not available with this model. The CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object can also be placed on dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) airloop branches or in arloop branches where the air flow to capacity ratio range is between 100 300 cfm/ton. 100% DOAS DX cooling coils operate in lower flow to capacity ratio range compared to regular DX cooling coils. The CoilSystem:Cooling:DX is selected to operate in DOAS application or in low flow to capacity ratio range by specifying YES to the input field Use Outdoor Air DX Cooling Coil . If this optional input field is left blank or specified as NO , then the coil is modeled as regular DX cooling coil. If the CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object is in an {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList} or in a {ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit:EquipmentList} then it is treated as 100% DOAS DX cooling coil only if the choice input field Use Outdoor Air DX Cooling Coil is set too YES . All the control options of the regular DX cooling coils are available to DOAS DX coils as well. Heating DX coils in DOAS airloop operate at the same flow to capacity ratio limits as the DOAS DX cooling coils.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for this component.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the schedule name that contains information on the availability of the DX coil to operate. A schedule value of 0 indicates that the coil is off for that time period. A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that the coil can operate during the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: DX Cooling Coil System Inlet Node Name 
DXCoolingCoilSystemInletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the DX cooling coil inlet node, as specified in the DX cooling coil object.
```
	
##  Field: DX Cooling Coil System Outlet Node Name 
DXCoolingCoilSystemOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the DX cooling coil outlet node, as specified in the cooling coil object.
```
	
##  Field: DX Cooling Coil System Sensor Node Name 
DXCoolingCoilSystemSensorNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the DX cooling coil control node, this is the node at which the temperature set point is specified by the set point manager.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Coil Object Type 
CoolingCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field specifies the type of DX cooling coil. The valid choices for this field are:
  {Coil:Cooling:DX}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed}
  {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed:ThermalStorage}
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Coil Name 
CoolingCoilName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name of the DX cooling coil.
As shown in the example below, correct specification of this system requires specification of the DX Cooling Coil object in addition to the CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object.
```
	
##  Field: Dehumidification Control Type 
DehumidificationControlType
```
This alpha field contains the type of dehumidification control. The following options are valid for this field:
{None} - meet sensible load only, no active dehumidification control
{MultiMode} - activate enhanced dehumidification mode as needed and operate to meet the sensible load. If a sensible load exists, the system will operate to meet that sensible load and may not meet the latent load. If no sensible load exists, and Run on Latent Load = Yes, the system will operate to meet the entire latent load. This option is used to model DX equipment with a switchable option such as subcool reheat. It is valid only with Cooling coil type = {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode} or {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted}. If the Run on Latent Load option below is set to Yes, this option may require the use of a heating coil and heating coil outlet air temperature set point manager downstream of this cooling coil to maintain the temperature set point.
{CoolReheat} - cool beyond the dry-bulb setpoint as required to meet the humidity setpoint. It is valid only with Cooling coil type = {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode}. This option requires the use of a heating coil and heating coil outlet air temperature set point manager downstream of this cooling coil to maintain the temperature set point.
The default is {None}. For all dehumidification controls, the max humidity setpoint on the control node is used. This must be set using a {{ZoneControl:Humidistat}} {{ZoneControl:Humidistat}} and one of:
  {{SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum}}
  {{SetpointManager:MultiZone:Humidity:Maximum}}
  {{SetpointManager:MultiZone:MaximumHumidity:Average}}
objects and {{SetpointManager:OutdoorAirPretreat}} (optional) objects. When extra dehumidification is required, the equipment may not be able to meet the humidity setpoint if its full capacity is not adequate.
```
	
##  Field: Run on Sensible Load 
RunOnSensibleLoad
```
This alpha field specifies if the unit will operate to meet a sensible load as determined by the inlet node dry-bulb temperature and the dry-bulb temperature setpoint on the control node. There are two valid choices, {Yes} or {No}. If {Yes}, unit will run if there is a sensible load. If {No}, unit will not run if there is only a sensible load. The default is {Yes}.
```
	
##  Field: Run on Latent Load 
RunOnLatentLoad
```
This alpha field specifies if the unit will operate to meet a latent load as determined by the inlet node humidity ratio and the max humidity setpoint on the control node. There are two valid choices, {Yes} or {No}. If {Yes}, unit will run if there is a latent load. If both a sensible and latent load exist, the system will operate to maintain the temperature set point. When only a latent load exists, the system will operate to meet the humidity ratio set point and requires the use of a heating coil and heating coil outlet air temperature set point manager downstream of this cooling coil to maintain the temperature set point. If {No}, unit will not run if there is only a latent load. The default is {No}.
```
	
##  Field: Use Outdoor Air DX Cooling Coil 
UseOutdoorAirDXCoolingCoil
```
This input field enables the Coil System DX Coil to be used for low air flow to capacity ratio range ( 100 300 cfm/ton). This flow to capacity ratio range is common in 100% dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) applications. Other airloop or zone HVAC systems may use this input filed if they operate at such a low flow to capacity ratio range. There are two valid choices, {Yes} or {No}. If {Yes}, the DX cooling coil is forced to operate in this flow to capacity ratio range or runs as 100% DOAS DX coil. If {No}, DX coil is used as regular DX coil. This input field is optional.

# CoilSystemHeatingDX

`CoilSystem:Heating:DX`
```
The CoilSystem:Heating:DX object is a virtual container component for a DX heating coil that provides the controls needed to operate the coil. Only single speed DX air-to-air heating coils are supported.
This component may be used as a heating coil in constant volume or variable volume air handlers. It can also be used in an outside air system (by including it in an {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList} object)or in a zone outdoor air unit (by including it in an {ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit:EquipmentList} object). This object is the one that is listed in the Branch or equipment list object rather than the coil itself.
The inlet and outlet nodes for the DX heat pump system are defined in the heating coil object. The control node is always the outlet node of the coil. This DX heat pump heating system requires that a (drybulb) temperature setpoint be placed on the outlet node using either a setpoint manager or the energy management system. The coil is controlled to attempt to meet that setpoint using a part load ratio modeling approach.
This model only supports continuous fan and cycling compressor operation -- cycling fan modeling is not available with this model.

# CoilSystemCoolingDXHeatExchangerAssisted

`CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted`
```
The heat exchanger-assisted DX cooling coil is a virtual component consisting of a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil and an air-to-air heat exchanger as shown in Figure{fig:schematic-of-the-coilsystem-cooling-dx} below. The air-to-air heat exchanger pre-conditions the air entering the cooling coil, and reuses this energy to post-condition the supply air leaving the cooling coil. This heat exchange process improves the latent removal performance of the cooling coil by allowing it to dedicate more of its cooling capacity toward dehumidification (lower sensible heat ratio).
This compound object models the basic operation of an air-to-air heat exchanger in conjunction with a cooling coil. The heat exchanger-assisted DX cooling coil does not have an operating schedule of its own; its operating schedule is governed by the availability schedules for the DX cooling coil and the air-to-air heat exchanger. This compound object is used in the same way as a DX cooling coil object. It cannot be used directly on a branch. It must be contained within a parent object such as CoilSystem:Cooling:DX or AirloopHVAC:UnitarySystem and others which list CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted as a valid cooling coil option.
To model a heat exchanger-assisted DX cooling coil, the input data file should include the following objects:
  CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted object
  Air-to-air heat exchanger object such as:
{HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate}
{HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent}
{HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow}
  DX cooling coil object such as:
{Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed}
{Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed}
{Coil:Cooling:DX}
In terms of controlling the operation of the heat exchanger, the heat exchanger is assumed to always provide its heat transfer when the associated DX cooling coil is operating and no high humidity control mechanism is specified. However, the heat exchanger\textquotesingle s energy transfer may be controlled (i.e., turned on and off) based on a zone air humidity level using either a humidistat (ref. {AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem}, {AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool} or {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool}) or a humidistat and a maximum humidity set point manager to place a humidity ratio set point on the appropriate control node (ref. {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX}). This model may also be used with the unitary changeover bypass system and the unitary air-to-air heat pump system (ref. {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool:VAVChangeoverBypass} and {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir}); however, the heat exchanger is assumed to always provide its heat transfer when the cooling coil operates and cannot be turned on and off based on a zone air humidity set point. Two zone air conditioners may also use this model for improved dehumidification. The first type is the packaged terminal heat pump (ref. {ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump}) where the heat exchanger's heat transfer is always active whenever the cooling coil operates. The second type is the window air conditioner (ref. {ZoneHVAC:WindowAirConditioner}) where the heat exchanger's heat transfer is always active when the cooling coil operates and no high humidity control mechanism is specified, OR the heat exchanger's heat transfer may be controlled based on zone air humidity level if a humidistat and high humidity set point manager are specified (maximum humidity ratio set point placed on the heat exchanger's exhaust air outlet node, ref. Figure{fig:schematic-of-the-coilsystem-cooling-dx}).
Links to the cooling coil and air-to-air heat exchanger specifications are provided in the input data syntax for this compound object. A description of each input field for this compound object is provided below.
NOTE: Node naming shown in Figure{fig:schematic-of-the-coilsystem-cooling-dx} is representative for {HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent}. For {HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate}, the exhaust air nodes are referred to as secondary air nodes. For {HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow}, the supply air nodes are referred to as regeneration air nodes and the exhaust air nodes as process air nodes.

```
	
##  Field: SCWH Mode Minimum Indoor Temperature to Allow  Overcooling 
SCWHModeMinimumIndoorTemperatureToAllowOvercooling
```
This numeric field defines an indoor air temperature [C] above which indoor overcooling is allowed in the cooling operation, i.e., allowing running the SCWH mode to cool down the indoor air below the thermostat setting temperature, and iterate the compressor speed to match the water heating load. It has to be noted that both the indoor temperature and ambient temperature lower bound settings have to be satisfied when allowing indoor overcooling by running the SCWH mode.
```
	
##  Field: SCWH Mode Minimum Outdoor Temperature to Allow Overcooling 
SCWHModeMinimumOutdoorTemperatureToAllowOvercooling
```
This numeric field defines an ambient air temperature above which indoor overcooling is allowed in the cooling operation, i.e., allowing running the SCWH mode to cool down the indoor air below the thermostat setting temperature, and iterate the compressor speed to match the water heating load. It has to be noted that both the indoor temperature and ambient temperature lower bound settings have to be satisfied when allowing overcooling the indoor by running the SCWH mode.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Indoor Temperature to Ignore Space Heating Call 
MinimumIndoorTemperatureToIgnoreSpaceHeatingCall
```
This numeric field defines an indoor air temperature [C] above which the water heating request has the higher priority and the space heating call can be ignored. The ASIHP will run the DWH mode to match the water heating load regardless of space heating call. It has to be noted that both the indoor temperature and ambient temperature lower bound settings have to be satisfied when a space heating call can be ignored.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Outdoor Temperature to Ignore Space Heating Call 
MinimumOutdoorTemperatureToIgnoreSpaceHeatingCall
```
This numeric field defines an ambient air temperature [C] above which the water heating request has the higher priority and the space heating call can be ignored. The ASIHP will run the DWH mode to match the water heating load regardless of space heating call. It has to be noted that both the indoor temperature and ambient temperature lower bound settings have to be satisfied when a space heating call can be ignored.
```
	
##  Field: SCWH Mode Load Matching Type 
SCWHModeLoadMatchingType
```
This choice field specifies the control in the SCWH mode. The choices are CoolingLoad or WaterHeatingLoad. During the SCWH operation when both the space cooling and water heating calls exist, if the field is CoolingLoad, it means that the compressor speed is iterated to match the space cooling load, and the water heating energy is a byproduct.  If this field is WaterHeatingLoad, it means that the speed is altered to match the water heating load, and the space cooling energy is a byproduct.
```
	
##  Field: SCWH Mode Minimum Speed 
SCWHModeMinimumSpeed
```
This numeric field defines a minimum speed level for running the SCWH; i.e., the compressor speed will be altered between the minimum speed specified and top speed, responding to the simultaneous space cooling and water heating calls. If there is only a water heating call, this input will not be used.
```
	
##  Field: SCDWH Mode Maximum Heated Water Vol Before Switching to SCWH 
SCDWHModeMaximumHeatedWaterVolBeforeSwitchingToSCWH
```
This numeric field defines an accumulative, heated water volume [m3] before switching from SCDWH to SCWH mode. When there are simultaneous space cooling and water heating calls, the ASIHP will run SCDWH first to satisfy a small water heating load. If the water volume heated by the heat pump goes beyond the limit, it means that the SCDWH, which uses a desuperheater, cannot provide enough capacity for the water heating request, and thus the SCWH mode will be turned on.
```
	
##  Field: SCDWH Mode Minimum Speed 
SCDWHModeMinimumSpeed
```
This numeric field defines a minimum speed level for running the SCDWH; i.e., the compressor speed will be altered between the minimum speed specified and top speed to match the space cooling load, and the water heating energy is a byproduct.
```
	
##  Field: SHDWH Mode Time Limit Before Turning on Electric Water Heating Element 
SHDWHModeTimeLimitBeforeTurningOnElectricWaterHeatingElement
```
This numeric field defines the running time [s] of the SHDWH mode before electric heating elements in the connected water tank are turned on if the water heating request cannot be satisfied on time. When there are simultaneous space heating and water heating calls, the ASIHP will run SHDWH mode first to satisfy a small water heating load. If the running time goes beyond the time limit, it means that the SHDWH mode, which uses a desuperheater, cannot provide enough capacity for the water heating request, and thus the electric elements in the water tank will be turned on to supplement the heating capacity.
```
	
##  Field: SHDWH Mode Minimum Speed 
SHDWHModeMinimumSpeed
```
This numeric field defines a minimum speed level for running the SHDWH mode; i.e., the compressor speed will be altered between the minimum speed and top speed to match the space heating load. Consequently, the water heating capacity is the byproduct.

# CoilWaterHeatingAirToWaterHeatPumpPumped

`Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Pumped`
```
EnergyPlus can model a heat pump water heater (HPWH) consisting of a water heater tank (e.g., \lstinline!WaterHeater:Mixed!), a direct expansion (DX) coil (i.e., an air-to-water DX compression system which includes a water heating coil, air coil, compressor, and water pump), and a fan to provide air flow across the air coil associated with the DX compression system. These objects work together to model a system which heats water using zone air, outdoor air, or a combination of zone and outdoor air as the primary heat source. From the air-side heat transfer perspective, the water-heater receives heating energy from air. Thus it is considered as a cooling coil, and the output variable names are using ``Cooling Coil''.
The {\lstinline!WaterHeater:HeatPump:PumpedCondenser!} compound object, water heater tank object (e.g., {\lstinline!WaterHeater:Mixed!}), and fan object (e.g., {\lstinline!Fan:OnOff!}) are defined elsewhere in this reference document. \lstinline!Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Pumped! object described here models an air-to-water DX compression system to determine its air-side and water-side performance. This DX coil object calculates the air-side sensible and latent cooling capacity at the specific operating conditions for each simulation timestep, as well as the condenser's water-side temperature difference at a given condenser water flow rate.
The heat pump water heater DX coil model performs the following major functions:
  calculates the electric consumption of the DX compressor and water pump
  calculates the amount of heat delivered to the water tank
  calculates the electric consumption of the compressor's crankcase heater
  calculates the air-side performance of the DX coil

##  Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name

```
This alpha field defines the name of a {quadratic} or {cubic} performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.
The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 <= PLR < 1), the following rules apply:
PLF >= 0.7 and PLF >= PLR
If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.
A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:
       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)
If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:
       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)

HeatingCapacityFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
This alpha field specifies the name of a {biquadratic} or {cubic} performance curve object (ref: Performance Curves) that defines the variation in DX coil heating capacity as a function of inlet fluid (air and water) temperatures. The biquadratic curve uses evaporator inlet air temperature (dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperature based on the field Evaporator Air Temperature Type for Curve Objects defined above) and condenser inlet water temperature as the independent variables. The cubic curve uses evaporator inlet air (dry-bulb or wet-bulb) temperature as the independent variable. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated heating capacity to give the heating capacity at specific operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point temperatures. If this field is left blank, the heating capacity remains constant (curve value assumed to be 1.0 for all conditions).

##  Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name 
PartLoadFractionCorrelationCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a {quadratic} or {cubic} performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.
The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 <= PLR < 1), the following rules apply:
PLF >= 0.7 and PLF >= PLR
If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.
A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:
       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)
If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:
       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)

`Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:VariableSpeed`
```
\lstinline!Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:VariableSpeed! object described here models an air-to-water DX compression system to determine its air-side and water-side performance.
Unlike the \lstinline!WaterHeater:HeatPump:PumpedCondenser! it has multiple, and up to 10, speeds.
It can be used in \lstinline!CoilSystem:IntegratedHeatPump:AirSource! or \lstinline!Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Pumped! which are defined elsewhere in this document.
This DX coil object calculates the air-side sensible and latent cooling capacity at the specific operating conditions for each simulation timestep, as well as the condenser's water-side temperature difference at a given condenser water flow rate.
This coil draws heating energy from air to the heater. Thus it is regarded as a cooling coil, as shown in the output variable names.
The heat pump water heater DX coil model performs the following major functions:
  calculates the electric consumption of the DX compressor and water pump
  calculates the amount of heat delivered to the water tank
  calculates the electric consumption of the compressor's crankcase heater
  calculates the air-side performance of the DX coil

# CoilCoolingWaterToAirHeatPumpVariableSpeedEquationFit

`Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:VariableSpeedEquationFit`
```
The Variable-Speed Water-to-Air Cooling Equation Fit Coil is a collection of performance curves that represent the cooling coil at various speed levels. The performance curves should be generated from the heat pump Reference Unit data. This is an equation-fit model that resembles a black box with no usage of heat transfer equations. On the other hand, the model uses the bypass factor approach to calculate sensible heat transfer rate, similar to the one used in the single-speed DX coil. The number of speed levels can range from 2 to 10. The cooling coil has four node connections, i.e.~two air sides and two water sides. The user needs to specify a nominal speed level, at which the gross rated total cooling capacity, rated volumetric air and water flow rates are sized. The rated capacity, rated volumetric flow rates represent the real situation in the air and water loops, and are used to determine and flow rates at various speed levels in the parent objects, e.g.~{AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem}, {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:WaterToAir} and {ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump}. It shall be mentioned that the performance correction curves, i.e. the temperature and flow fraction correction curves, should be normalized to the capacity and flow rates at each individual speed and at the rated conditions, similar to the performance curves used in the DX coils. However, the performance values, e.g.~gross capacities, gross COPs, gross SHRs and flow rates at individual speed levels, should be given regarding a specific unit from the Reference Unit catalog data. In the following content, the statement started with Reference Unit means the actual Reference Unit catalog data. The rated conditions for obtaining the capacities, COPs and SHRs are at indoor dry-bulb temperature of 26.67°C (80°F), wet bulb temperature of 19.44°C (67°F), and the source side entering water temperature of 29.4°C (85°F). Some equations are provided below to help explain the function of the various performance curves and data fields. For a detailed description of the algorithm and how the curves are used in the calculations, please see the Engineering Reference.

NominalTimeForCondensateRemovalToBegin
```
This numeric field defines the nominal time (in seconds) after startup for condensate to begin leaving the coil's condensate drain line at the coil's rated airflow and temperature conditions, starting with a dry coil. Nominal time is equal to the ratio of the energy of the coil's maximum condensate holding capacity (J) to the coil's steady-state latent capacity (W). Suggested value is 1000; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero.
```
	
##  Field: Ratio of Initial Moisture Evaporation Rate and Steady State Latent Capacity 
RatioOfInitialMoistureEvaporationRateAndSteadyStateLatentCapacity
```
This numeric field defines ratio of the initial moisture evaporation rate from the cooling coil (when the compressor first turns off, in Watts) and the coil's steady-state latent capacity (Watts) at rated airflow and temperature conditions. Suggested value is 1.5; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero.

```
	
##  Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name 
PartLoadFractionCorrelationCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible or latent load/steady-state sensible or latent cooling capacity for Speed 1), in the case that the unit operates under the lowest speed, i.e.~on/off. The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep for Speed 1. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 <= PLR < 1), the following rules apply:
PLF >= 0.7 and PLF >= PLR
If PLF < 0.7, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0. A typical part load fraction correlation would be:
PLF = 0.85 + 0.15 \times PLR
If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:
PLF = 0.85 + 0.0 \times PLR

This value is only used to calculate the following metrics according to the 2023 version of the ANSI/AHRI 210-240 standard: Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER2), Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER), Integrated Energy Efficiency Ratio (IEER) and the Standard Rating (Net) Cooling Capacity.  These metrics will be outputs in the EnergyPlus eio file (ref. EnergyPlus Engineering Reference, Section 15.2 Coils). This value is not used for modeling the evaporator (cooling coil) fan during simulations; instead, it is used for calculating SEER2, EER, IEER, and Standard Rating (Net) Cooling Capacity to assist the user in verifying their inputs for modeling this type of equipment. 
Note 1: Standard Ratings using this field will be reported in the 2023 Standard Ratings for DX Coils table
Note 2: two values are calculated for SEER2. 'SEER2 User' is calculated using user-input PLF curve and cooling coefficient of degradation. 'SEER2 Standard' is calculated using AHRI Std 210/240-2023 default PLF curve and cooling coefficient of degradation.
Note 3: SEER2 User, SEER2 Standard, EER, IEER, and Standard Rating (Net) Cooling Capacity -- with cooling capacity less than 65,000 Btu/hr - will be calculated according to ANSI/AHRI standard 210-240 (2023).
Note 4: EER, IEER, and Standard Rating (Net) Cooling Capacity -- with cooling capacities between 65,000 and 135,000 Btu/hr -- will be calculated according to ANSI/AHRI standard 340-360 (2022).

`Coil:Heating:WaterToAirHeatPump:VariableSpeedEquationFit`

The Variable-Speed Water-to-Air Heating Equation Fit Coil is a collection of performance curves that represent the heating coil at various speed levels. The performance curves should be generated from the heat pump Reference Unit catalog data. This is an equation-fit model that resembles a black box with no usage of heat transfer equations. The number of speed levels can range from 2 to 10. The heating coil has four node connections, i.e.~two air sides and two water sides. The user needs to specify a nominal speed level, at which the rated capacity, rated volumetric air and water flow rates are sized. The rated capacity, rated volumetric flow rates represent the real situation in the air and water loops, and are used to determine the flow rates at various speed levels in the parent objects, e.g.~{AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem}, {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:WaterToAir} and {ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump}. It shall be mentioned that the performance correction curves, i.e. the temperature and flow fraction correction curves, should be normalized to the capacity and flow rates at each individual speed and at the rated operating conditions, similar to the performance curves used in the DX coils. On the other hand, the performance values at individual speed levels, e.g.~capacities, COPs and flow rates, should be given regarding a specific unit from the Reference Unit catalog data.

The rated conditions for obtaining the capacities and COPs are at indoor dry-bulb temperature of 21.1°C (70°F) and the source side entering water temperature of 21.1°C (70°F). Some equations are provided below to help explain the function of the various performance curves and data fields.

##  Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name

This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, heating load/steady-state heating capacity for Speed 1), in the case that the unit operates under the lowest speed, i.e.~on/off. The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep for Speed 1. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 <= PLR < 1), the following rules apply:
PLF >= 0.7 and PLF >= PLR
If PLF < 0.7, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0. A typical part load fraction correlation would be:
PLF = 0.85 + 0.15 \times PLR
If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:
PLF = 0.85 + 0.0 \times PLR

##  Field: Speed <x> Rated Waste Heat Fraction of Power Input 
SpeedXRatedWasteHeatFractionOfPowerInput
```
The fraction of heat input to heating that is available as recoverable waste heat at full load and rated conditions for Speed <x> operation. The part of heat is not delivered to the indoor side.
```
	
##  Field: Speed <x> Waste Heat Function of Temperature Curve Name 
SpeedXWasteHeatFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
The name of a bi-quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the waste heat recovery as a function of indoor dry-bulb temperature and the entering water temperature for Speed <x> from the Reference Unit data. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated recoverable waste heat at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point). The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point.
The actual recoverable waste heat at Speed <x> is calculated as below:
ActualWasteHeat@SpeedLevel\left( x \right) = ActualPower@SpeedLevel\left( x \right) \\
\quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \times WasteHeatFrac@SpeedLevel(x) \\
\quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \times WasteHeatTempModFac@SpeedLevel(x)

# CoilCoolingDXSingleSpeedThermalStorage

`Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed:ThermalStorage`
```
This object models a special direct expansion (DX) cooling coil that includes methods of storing thermal energy within the cooling coil package. This packaged thermal storage cooling coil model includes all of the equipment needed to charge and discharge and the Thermal Energy Storage (TES) tank itself. This coil object is used with {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX} object and a constant volume supply fan, but all other subcomponents are contained within the package.
Some types of devices may have a process air cooling section that actually has two coils, one an evaporator and the second some other kind of coil that cools by discharging the TES tank. There may also be two separate heat engines inside the package with two compressors. The model wraps these complexities inside of the model which considers just one process air cooling section that combines both types of coils and one heat rejection condenser section that rejects heat from both engines. The operating modes that are likely to have two heat engines offer dual sets of rating points and performance curves to model the energy and capacity implications separately.
The model offers various modes of operation that can be controlled over time using either a schedule or EMS actuators. The user can choose which of the five operating modes are present in the device. Each of the modes has its own separate set of performance characteristics and curves and the model can change abruptly from one mode to the next. For example when using the schedule control, the TES coil can be put into Charge Only Mode for some number of hours at night, operated in Cooling Only Mode during the mild morning hours, and run in Discharge Only Mode during the hottest part of the day. Custom control routines can be programmed using EMS to obtain a dynamic, supervisory control algorithm.
  Off Mode. This mode is always present. Although the coil will not do any cooling, the state of the TES tank is still modeled since it can continue to exchange heat with the surrounding ambient air.
  Cooling Only Mode. This mode is where the coil cools air at the evaporator using a model that is very similar to the regular, single speed DX cooling coil. The same five performance curves are used to describe cooling capacity and electric power use. The sensible heat ratio is described using two performance curves in the same as is available for 100% outdoor air coils. The TES tank is neither charged or discharged but it continues to exchange heat with the surrounding ambient air.
  Cooling And Charge Mode. This mode is where the coil both cools air at the evaporator and cools the TES tank at the same time. The model supports separate performance characteristics when there two separate heat engines, one for evaporator cooling and one for charging the TES tank.
  Cooling and Discharge Mode. This mode is where the coil cools process air and heat is rejected to both the condenser section and the TES tank at the same time. The model supports separate performance characteristics when there two separate heat engines, one for evaporator cooling and one for TES cooling.
  Charge Only Mode. This mode is where the coil charges the TES tank but does not provide any cooling at the process air cooling section.
  Discharge Only Mode. This mode is where the coil cools process air by discharging the TES tank.
This cooling coil can be autosized. The cooling capacity for the cooling only mode is sized to meet the air system's final design cooling capacity. The cooling capacity for the other modes, and the storage capacity, can all be scaled relative to that one capacity using sizing factors that can be input by the user.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
A unique name for this TES coil object, assigned by user.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
The name of a schedule that determines whether the TES coil is available for cooling during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during a given time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that unit must be in off mode. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Operating Mode Control Method 
OperatingModeControlMethod
```
This field determines how the TES coil is to be controlled in terms of which operating mode is in effect for a given time period. There are two choices, ScheduledModes or EMSControlled. Choosing ScheduledModes indicates that the operating mode is determined by the values in a schedule that is named in the following input field. Choosing EMSControlled indicates that the operating mode is determined by the state of an EMS actuator called Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed:ThermalStorage with the control type Operating Mode.
```
	
##  Field: Operation Mode Control Schedule Name 
OperationModeControlScheduleName
```
This field is used (and required) if the operating mode control method is set to ScheduledModes in the previous input field. The control schedule consists of a series of integer values that indicate what mode the TES coil should operate in for a given time period. The values for various operating modes have been programmed to be as follows:
\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
  Off Mode
  Cooling Only Mode
  Cooling And Charge Mode
  Cooling And Discharge Mode
  Charge Only Mode
  Discharge Only Mode
```
	
##  Field: Storage Type 
StorageType
```
This field is used to determine what type of material is used for thermal storage. There are two basic types of thermal storage material, fluid or ice. For fluid tanks, the material can be water or a user-defined fluid such as a glycol and the storage of thermal energy accompanies changes in the temperature of the fluid in the tank. For ice tanks, the material is water ice and the storage of thermal energy accompanies changes in the fraction of ice. This input field has three possible choices: {Water}, {UserDefinedFluidType}, Or {Ice}. Choose {Water} for a fluid tank TES based on water. Choose {UserDefinedFluidType} for a fluid tank TES based on custom or glycol type fluid. Choose {Ice} for ice-based TES tank.
```
	
##  Field: User Defined Fluid Type 
UserDefinedFluidType
```
This field is used to declare what type of user defined fluid is contained in the TES tank. This input field is only used (and required) if the previous field is set to UserDefinedFluidType. Water, EthyleneGlycol, and PropyleneGlycol have fluid properties built-in to EnergyPlus. Using a {FluidProperties:GlycolConcentration} object allows specifying a mixture of water and a glycol and the name of one can be entered here. For other types of fluids, a complete set of fluid property data is needed, see {FluidProperties:Name}, FluidProperties:Temperature, etc.
```
	
##  Field: Fluid Storage Volume [m^{3}] 
FluidStorageVolumeM3
```
This field is used to describe the size of fluid-based TES tank, in m^{3}. The storage volume can be automatically calculated based on the cooling capacity and sizing factor.
```
	
##  Field: Ice Storage Capacity [GJ] 
IceStorageCapacityGJ
```
This field is used to describe the size of ice-based TES tank, in GJ. The storage capacity can be automatically calculated based on the cooling capacity and a sizing factor.
```
	
##  Field: Storage Capacity Sizing Factor [hr] 
StorageCapacitySizingFactorHr
```
This field is used if one of the previous two fields is set to autocalculate. The value entered here is a time duration, in hours. This time period is used for calculating a storage capacity. The basic idea is that storage be sized such that the TES can provide cooling at rated capacity for this amount of time. The rated capacity used in the sizing calculation is the Discharge Only Mode Rated Storage Discharging Capacity unless the Discharge Only mode is not available in which case it is the Cooling Only Mode Rated Total Evaporator Cooling Capacity. This sizing factor approach allows scaling the storage size relative to the TES coil's capacity. The sizing factor is applied for an ice-based TES by simply multiplying the rated capacity by the time duration (converted to seconds). For fluid-based TES, a change in fluid temperature of 10°C is assumed to calculate the tank volume.
```
	
##  Field: Storage Tank Ambient Temperature Node Name 
StorageTankAmbientTemperatureNodeName
```
This field is used to assign the environmental conditions surrounding the TES coil. The thermal storage tank exchanges heat with its surroundings and the boundary conditions for those surrounding are taken from this node named in this field. Typically this is the name of a node declared to be an outdoor air node. This field is required.
```
	
##  Field: Storage Tank to Ambient U-value Times Area Heat Transfer Coefficient [W/K] 
StorageTankToAmbientUValueTimesAreaHeatTransferCoefficientWK
```
This field is used to characterize the rate at which heat is exchanged between the TES tank and the surrounding ambient conditions, in W/K. This is an overall UA value for the tank where the U-factor and surface area are combined into one coefficient. Heat loss or gain to the TES tank is modeled using \dot Q = {\left( {UA} \right)_{Tank}}left( {{T_{TES}} - {T_{Amb}}} \right) . This field is required.
```
	
##  Field: Fluid Storage Tank Rating Temperature [C] 
FluidStorageTankRatingTemperatureC
```
This field is used to define what temperature is used for rating conditions when using a fluid storage tank. This field is only used for Storage Type of Water or UserDefinedFluidType. The temperature here is used for declaring the state of the TES fluid tank that corresponds to Rated conditions. The temperature entered here is used to define fluid properties and to characterize the performance curves that depend on the state of the TES.
```
	
##  Field: Rated Evaporator Air Flow Rate [m^{3}/s] 
RatedEvaporatorAirFlowRateM3S
```
This field is the air volume flow rate through the coil, in m^{3}/s, at rating conditions. This is the rated air flow rate through the evaporator (and any other air cooling devices that are in series with the main evaporator). The coil can be operated with a different flow rate than this rated flow rate and the performance of the unit scales accordingly using the curves that are of the type Function of Flow Fraction Curve. All of the other rated values for capacity, COP, and SHR values, for all the various modes, should be determined at the same air flow rate used here. This field can be autosized.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporator Air Inlet Node Name 
EvaporatorAirInletNodeName
```
This field is the name of an HVAC system node that the coil draws in as its inlet air. This for the evaporator's connection to air system but it may include other air cooling devices that are in series with the evaporator and contained within the packaged TES coil. This node must be unique across the model. This field is required.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporator Air Outlet Node Name 
EvaporatorAirOutletNodeName
```
This field is the name of an HVAC system node that the coils sends its outlet air. This for the evaporator's connection to air system but it may include other air cooling devices that are in series with the evaporator and contained within the packaged TES coil. This node must be unique across the model. This field is required.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Only Mode Available 
CoolingOnlyModeAvailable
```
This field is used to indicate if the packaged TES coil includes a mode with only cooling and no equipment is interacting with TES tank to charge or discharge it. The choices are Yes or No. This field is required.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Only Mode Rated Total Evaporator Cooling Capacity [W] 
CoolingOnlyModeRatedTotalEvaporatorCoolingCapacityW
```
This field is used to specify the total, full load cooling capacity (sensible plus latent), in Watts, of the TES coil at rated conditions, while operating in Cooling Only Mode. The rating conditions are air entering the cooling coil at 26.7°C drybulb, 19.4°C wetbulb and air entering the outdoor condenser section at 35°C drybulb and 23.9°C wetbulb, and the air flow rate specified in Rated Evaporator Air Flow Rate. Capacity should be gross (i.e.~supply air fan heat is NOT included). This total cooling capacity is a central value for TES coil in the sense that it is the basis for various autocalculated sizes for the rest of the model which can be scaled off of this one value. This field is required if Cooling Only Mode is available or if another operating mode's capacity, or storage capacity, will be autocalculated from this value. This field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Only Mode Rated Sensible Heat Ratio 
CoolingOnlyModeRatedSensibleHeatRatio
```

# SecondaryCoilsOfDXSystemAndHeatPump

`Secondary Coils of DX System and Heat Pump`
```
Secondary Coils reject to or remove heat from a secondary zone as part of a DX system or an air-to-air heat pump. Secondary coil refers to a condenser of a DX system or a heat pump in cooling operating mode or an evaporator of a heat pump in heating mode. The secondary coil (e.g.~condenser) of DX system or heat pumps is commonly installed outdoor but when installed inside a zone either heat is dumped to or extracted from a secondary zone. A secondary zone is a conditioned or unconditioned zone where the secondary coil is installed. Secondary coils are not standalone DX coils but they are add-on features on existing DX coil objects. A secondary DX coil is modeled by specifying additional inputs in one of the following DX coil objects: {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed}, {Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed}, {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed}, {Coil:Cooling:DX:MultiSpeed}, and {Coil:Heating:DX:MultiSpeed}. These additional inputs allow us to model the heat rejected or extracted by the secondary coil while the primary (active) coil is serving another controlled zone as shown in {SecondaryCoilsFigure1}{Figure}. A secondary coil is not controlled directly but responds to the requirements of the primary DX coil. Heat is rejected or extracted depending on the primary DX coil operating modes. For instance, heat rejected to a secondary zone by a condenser of a DX system or a heat pump is considered as sensible only whereas the energy extracted from a secondary zone may contain sensible and latent components.
Applications of this technology include: inter-zone heat pump in NTED (Dixon, 2010), and PTAC or PTHP serving Offices attached to a Warehouse, where the office partially or fully enclosed by the warehouse and the condenser is inside the Warehouse. Heat rejected or extracted by the secondary DX coil installed in a secondary zone is estimated from the DX coil models and it is considered as internal gains of the secondary zone. The capacity and electric power input of the DX system and heat pumps are determined from the operating modes of the primary cooling or heating DX coils. Calculation of a secondary coil tracks the operating modes of the primary DX coil serving the primary conditioned zone(s). Currently allowed DX coil models are single speed, two speed and multi speed DX Systems and Heat Pumps. To model secondary DX coils the condenser type should be AirCooled. There is no need to specify the condenser air inlet node. The model uses zone air node as the secondary coil air inlet node. And the fuel type in multispeed DX coils should Electricity.
{Cooling Operating Mode}: the primary DX cooling coil of a DX system serving a primary zone is active and heat is rejected by the secondary coil (condenser) into a secondary zone. The secondary zone name is specified in DX cooling coil objects. This operating mode applies to a DX cooling system and cooling operating mode of air-to-air single and multi-speed heat pumps. Heat rejected by a secondary coil (condenser) calculated at each time step becomes internal gain of the secondary zone as shown in {SecondaryCoilsFigure2}{Figure}. Whenever a secondary zone name is specified in DX cooling coil objects, the secondary DX coil model calculation is invoked. The only input field required to invoke the secondary DX coil in cooling operating model is to add a zone name in the input field {Zone Name for Condenser Placement} in the DX cooling coil object.
```

##  Field: Zone Name for Condenser Placement 
ZoneNameForCondenserPlacement
```
This input field is name of a conditioned or unconditioned zone where the secondary coil (condenser) of DX system or a heat pump is to be placed. This is an optional input field specified only when user desires to reject the condenser heat into this zone. The heat rejected is modeled as sensible internal gain of a secondary zone.
Following is an example input for a single-speed cooling DX coil with secondary DX coil run option.

  NORTH ZONE;              !- Zone Name for Condenser Placement
{Heating Operating Mode}: When a heat pump operates in heating mode then energy is extracted from the secondary zone. Total energy extracted from a secondary zone may contain sensible and latent components. The secondary coil (evaporator) model checks for the coil inlet and outlet air condition to determine if dehumidification has occurred. The sensible and latent split of the energy extracted is done using a user specified rated sensible heat ratio (SHR) and SHR modifier curves for temperature and secondary air flow fraction. If the coil operation is dry, then the SHR is set to 1.0. In addition, the model assumes that condensed water is drained to the outside. If defrosting operation is on, then the defrosting melts the frost and the liquid water from the collecting pan is drained to the outside. Thus, defrosting energy is not included in the zone energy balance. The six optional input fields required in the DX heating coils are the following. This object is extensible by repeating the last five input fields depending on the speed of the heating DX coil:
```
	
##  Field: Zone Name for Evaporator Placement 
ZoneNameForEvaporatorPlacement
```
This input field is name of a conditioned or unconditioned zone where the secondary coil (evaporator) of a heat pump is installed. This is an optional input field specified only when user desires to extract heat from the zone via secondary coil. Heat extracted is modeled as internal gain. If the primary DX system is a heat pump, then the zone name should be the same as the zone name specified for placing the secondary cooling DX coil.
```
	
##  Field: Speed Secondary Coil Air Flow Rate 
SpeedSecondaryCoilAirFlowRate
```
This input value is the secondary coil (evaporator) air flow rate when the heat pump is working in heating mode or the secondary coil (condenser) air flow rate when the heat pump is working in cooling mode. This input field is auto-sizable.
```
	
##  Field: Speed Secondary Coil Fan Flow Scaling Factor 
SpeedSecondaryCoilFanFlowScalingFactor
```
This input field is scaling factor for autosizing the secondary DX coil fan flow rate. The secondary air flow rate is determined by multiplying the primary DX coil rated air flow rate by the fan flow scaling factor. Default value is 1.25. If the secondary coil fan flow rate is not autosized, then the secondary coil fan flow scaling factor is set to 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Speed Nominal Sensible Heat Ratio of Secondary Coil 
SpeedNominalSensibleHeatRatioOfSecondaryCoil
```
This input value is the nominal sensible heat ratio used to split the heat extracted by a secondary DX coil (evaporator) of a heat pump into sensible and latent components. This is an optional input field. If this input field is left blank, then pure sensible internal heat gain is assumed, i.e., sensible heat ratio of 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Speed Sensible Heat Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve Name 
SpeedSensibleHeatRatioModifierFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
This input field is name of sensible heat ratio modifier biquadratic curve. The value of this curve modifies the nominal sensible heat ratio for current time step depending on the secondary zone air node wet-bulb temperature and the heating DX coil entering air dry-bulb temperature. This is an optional input field. If this input field is left blank, then the nominal sensible heat ratio modifier curve value for temperature is set to 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Speed Sensible Heat Ratio Modifier Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name 
SpeedSensibleHeatRatioModifierFunctionOfFlowFractionCurveName
```
This input field is name of sensible heat ratio modifier curve as function of secondary air flow fraction. The value of this curve modifies the nominal sensible heat ratio for current time step depending on the secondary coil air flow fraction. This is an optional input field. If this input field is left blank, then the sensible heat ratio modifier curve value for flow fraction is set to 1.0.

# HumidifierSteamElectric

`Humidifier:Steam:Electric`
```
The electric steam humidifier is a component that represents an electrically heated, self contained steam humidifier. The component uses electrical energy to convert ordinary tap water to steam which it then injects into the supply air stream by means of a blower fan. The actual unit might be an electrode-type humidifier or a resistance-type humidifier.
The humidifier model includes local control of the humidifier unit to meet a humidity ratio setpoint on its air outlet node. A set point manager is needed to put a setpoint on the exit node but no other local controllers are needed. The humidifier will add moisture to meet the humidity ratio setpoint.

# DehumidifierDesiccantNoFans

`Dehumidifier:Desiccant:NoFans`
```
This object models a solid desiccant dehumidifier (excluding associated fans). The process air stream is the air which is dehumidified. The regen air stream is the air which is heated to regenerate the desiccant. This object determines the process air outlet conditions, the load on the regeneration heating coil, the electric power consumption for the wheel rotor motor, and the regeneration air fan mass flow rate. All other heat exchangers are modeled as separate objects connected to the inlet and outlet nodes of the dehumidifier. The solid desiccant dehumidifier is typically used in an {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem} object, but can also be specified in any {AirLoopHVAC}. The regeneration heating coil can be Gas, Electric, Steam , or Hot Water coil. When hot water coil is selected as regeneration heating coil user-defined curves designed for lower temperature operation must be specified in the input field Performance Model Type along with the Nominal Regeneration Temperature input field. The default performance model type is valid for higher nominal regeneration temperature (e.g.~121C).

Specifies whether the Default performance model or UserCurves curves should be used to model the performance. The default model is a generic solid desiccant wheel using performance curves of the form:
curve = C1 + C2*edb + C3*edb**2 + C4*ew + C5*ew**2 + C6*vel + C7*vel**2 + C8*edb*ew + C9*edb**2*ew**2 + C10*edb*vel + C11*edb**2*vel**2 + C12*ew*vel + C13*ew**2*vel**2 + C14*ALOG(edb) + C15*ALOG(ew) + C16*ALOG(vel)
edb = process entering drybulb temperature [C]\\
ew = process entering humidity ratio [kgWater/kgDryAir]\\
vel = process air velocity [m/s]
The Default curves are valid for the following range of process inlet conditions: dry-bulb temperatures of 1.67C (35F) to 48.9C (120F) and humidity ratios of 0.002857 kgWater/kgDryAir (20 gr/lb) to 0.02857 kgWater/kgDryAir (200 gr/lb). If the process inlet conditions are outside this range, the dehumidifier will not operate.
If UserCurves are specified, then performance is calculated as follows:
Leaving Dry-bulb = (Leaving Dry-Bulb Function of Entering Dry-Bulb and Humidity Ratio Curve) * (Leaving Dry-Bulb Function of Air Velocity Curve)
Leaving Humidity Ratio = (Leaving Humidity Ratio Function of Entering Dry-Bulb and Humidity Ratio Curve) * (Leaving Humidity Ratio Function of Air Velocity Curve)
Regeneration Energy = (Regeneration Energy Function of Entering Dry-Bulb and Humidity Ratio Curve) * (Regeneration Energy Function of Air Velocity Curve)
Regeneration Velocity = (Regeneration Velocity Function of Entering Dry-Bulb and Humidity Ratio Curve) * (Regeneration Velocity Function of Air Velocity Curve)
The UserCurves are limited to the following range of process inlet conditions (essentially not limited): dry-bulb temperatures of 73.3C (-100F) to 65.6C (150F) and humidity ratios of 0.0 kgWater/kgDryAir (0 gr/lb) to 0.21273 kgWater/kgDryAir (1490 gr/lb). If the process inlet conditions are outside this range, the dehumidifier will not operate.
When the Default performance model is selected, the remaining fields are ignored.

# DehumidifierDesiccantSystem

`Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System`
```
The Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object models the dehumidification of an air stream, normally called the process air stream. A second heated air stream, called the regeneration air stream, is used to remove the collected moisture from the desiccant heat exchanger and this moisture-laden air is then usually exhausted from the building. This Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object is similar to the {Dehumidifier:Desiccant:NoFans} object but has some additional modeling capabilities.
The Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object in EnergyPlus is a compound object that can be placed anywhere in an air loop ({AirLoopHVAC}). Common locations for this object are in an {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem} or in the main air loop ({AirLoopHVAC}) downstream of a cooling coil (postcooling desiccant dehumidifier). This compound object coordinates the operation of several children objects: a desiccant heat exchanger, a regeneration air fan, and an optional regeneration air heater. Gas, Electric, Steam, or Hot Water heating coils can be used for regenerator air heaters. If this dehumidifier is placed in the main air loop immediately downstream of a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil, then the dehumidifier's operation can be coordinated with the operation of the companion DX coil and it is also possible to specify that the DX system's condenser waste heat can be used to help regenerate the desiccant heat exchanger. For the case of condenser waste heat regeneration, an optional exhaust fan can also be modeled by this desiccant dehumidifier compound object to help maintain a set point temperature for air entering the regeneration side of the desiccant heat exchanger.
It is important to note that the optional exhaust air fan is modeled internal to the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System and a separate fan object should {not} be added to the input data file (idf) for this fan. On the other hand, a separate fan object {is} required in the input data file for the regeneration air fan.
A schematic of the compound object Dehumidifier:Desiccant:Systemis shown in Figure{fig:schematic-of-dehumidifier-desiccant-system} with the draw through regeneration air fan placement. Figure{fig:schematic-of-dehumidifier-desiccant-system-001} shows the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object configured with the blow through regeneration air fan placement.
NOTE: As with any air loop compound object, the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object itself is specified on the {AirLoopHVAC} Branch or in the {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList} for an {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem}. The children objects (e.g., desiccant heat exchanger, regeneration air fan, and optional regeneration air heater) must be specified separately in the input data file and their inlet/outlet connections must be as shown in Figure{fig:schematic-of-dehumidifier-desiccant-system} or Figure{fig:schematic-of-dehumidifier-desiccant-system-001}.
Currently the only heat exchanger choice for this object is HeatExchanger:Desiccant: BalancedFlow. So to model a Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System located in an air loop, the input data file should include the following objects:
  Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System (in an air loop ({AirLoopHVAC}) Branch or {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList} for an {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem})
  {HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow} (desiccant heat exchanger child object)
  {HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1} (desiccant heat exchanger data object)
  {ZoneControl:Humidistat}, and one of:
  {SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum}
  {SetpointManager:MultiZone:Humidity:Maximum}
  {SetpointManager:MultiZone:MaximumHumidity:Average}
  (when in an air loop ({AirLoopHVAC}) Branch), and {SetpointManager:OutdoorAirPretreat} (when in an {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem}) to place a maximum humidity ratio set point on the sensor node, typically the process air outlet node
  {Fan:SystemModel}, {Fan:OnOff}, or {Fan:ConstantVolume} (regeneration air fan)
  {Coil:Heating:Electric} or {Coil:Heating:Fuel} (optional regeneration air heater)
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed}, {Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed}, or {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode} (optional companion cooling coil)
If the user wants to model the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System in an {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem}, then the process air path of the dehumidifier should be located in the outdoor air stream and the regeneration air path may be placed in the relief air stream or modeled by the desiccant dehumidifier itself where the first node for the regeneration inlet air stream must be an outdoor air node. If the user wants to model the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System in an air loop ({AirLoopHVAC}) Branch, then the process air path of the dehumidifier should be located in the air loop Branch object. For this case, the regeneration air stream is modeled by the desiccant dehumidifier object itself (i.e., not part of an air loop Branch statement) and the first node for the regeneration inlet air stream must be an outdoor air node (ref. Figure{fig:schematic-of-dehumidifier-desiccant-system} or Figure{fig:schematic-of-dehumidifier-desiccant-system-001}).
A description of each input field for this object is provided below:
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
A unique, user-assigned name for a particular Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System. Any reference to this dehumidifier by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the dehumidifier can operate during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the dehumidifier can operate. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the dehumidifier will not operate (i.e., no heat exchange will take place and the regeneration air fan does not operate). If the field is blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods. For the case where companion cooling coil regeneration air heating has been specified, the desiccant dehumidifier's exhaust fan serves as the condenser air fan for the cooling coil system so this availability schedule will not disable exhaust fan operation.
```
	
##  Field: Desiccant Heat Exchanger Object Type 
DesiccantHeatExchangerObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the type of desiccant heat exchanger used with this dehumidifier. Currently, the only valid choice is {HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow}.
```
	
##  Field: Desiccant Heat Exchanger Name 
DesiccantHeatExchangerName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the desiccant heat exchanger used with this dehumidifier.
```
	
##  Field: Sensor Node Name 
SensorNodeName
```
This alpha field specifies the name of the air loop node used to control desiccant heat exchanger operation. A set point manager must be used to place a maximum humidity ratio set point on this node (e.g., {SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum} or {SetpointManager:OutdoorAirPretreat}).
```
	
##  Field: Regeneration Air Fan Object Type 
RegenerationAirFanObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the type of regeneration air fan used. Available fan types are {Fan:SystemModel}, {Fan:OnOff} and {Fan:ConstantVolume}.
```
	
##  Field: Regeneration Air Fan Name 
RegenerationAirFanName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the regeneration air fan used with this dehumidifier.
```
	
##  Field: Regeneration Air Fan Placement 
RegenerationAirFanPlacement
```
This alpha field specifies the fan configuration used in the desiccant dehumidifier. Valid choices are BlowThrough and DrawThrough , with a default of DrawThrough if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Regeneration Air Heater Object Type 
RegenerationAirHeaterObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the type of heating coil used to heat the regeneration air stream. This field may be left blank when no regeneration air heater is required. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connector objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the regeneration air heating coil does not require additional controller or {Controller:WaterCoil} object. The parent object (Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System) itself provides the ``controller'' function of modulating water flow. For autosizing regeneration air heating coil the {Design Coil Inlet Air Condition} used is the outdoor air condition if the desiccant system is on the primary air loop, or else if the desiccant system is on outdoor air system then it is the return air condition. The {Design Coil Outlet Air Temperature} is the {Regeneration Inlet Air Setpoint Temperature} specified in the input field below. Valid heating coil choices are:
  {Coil:Heating:Electric}
  {Coil:Heating:Fuel}
  {Coil:Heating:Water}
  {Coil:Heating:Steam}
```
	
##  Field: Regeneration Air Heater Name 
RegenerationAirHeaterName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the heating coil used to heat the regeneration air stream. This field may be left blank when no regeneration air heater is required.
```
	
##  Field: Regeneration Inlet Air Setpoint Temperature 
RegenerationInletAirSetpointTemperature
```
This optional numeric field specifies the regeneration air inlet temperature setpoint in Celsius. The regeneration air heater and/or the companion coil regeneration air heating will be controlled to this temperature to the extent possible. This field may be left blank when no regeneration air heater is required or when control of the exhaust fan used with the companion coil regeneration air heating option is not required. If regeneration air heating coils is autosized, then the value of this input field is used as the {Regeneration Air Heater Design Outlet Air Temperature} for the coil sizing calculation. The default value is 46.0 degrees.
```
	
##  Field: Companion Cooling Coil Object Type 
CompanionCoolingCoilObjectType
```
This optional alpha field contains the type of companion cooling coil used with this desiccant dehumidifier. The only valid choices are {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed}, {Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed}, and {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode}.
```
	
##  Field: Companion Cooling Coil Name 
CompanionCoolingCoilName
```
This optional alpha field contains the name of the companion cooling coil used with this desiccant dehumidifier. This field may be left blank when no companion cooling coil is being modeled.
```
	
##  Field: Companion Cooling Coil Upstream of Dehumidifier Process Inlet 
CompanionCoolingCoilUpstreamOfDehumidifierProcessInlet
```
This choice field specifies if the companion cooling coil is located immediately upstream of the dehumidifiers process inlet. Valid choices are Yes and No. If Yes is selected, then the outlet air node for the companion cooling coil must be the same as the dehumidifier's process air inlet node (i.e., the process air inlet node name for the desiccant heat exchanger specified for this desiccant dehumidifier). For this case, the companion cooling coil and the desiccant dehumidifier are assumed to operate in tandem ; that is, if the simulation determines that the companion cooling coil is unable to meet the humidity set point specified on the sensor node based on its own operation, then the desiccant dehumidifier operates at the same time and for the same duration as the cooling coil to provide improved dehumidification. If No is selected, then the dehumidifier will control to the humidity set point specified on the sensor node to the extent possible. The default value is No if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Companion Coil Regeneration Air Heating 
CompanionCoilRegenerationAirHeating
```
This choice field determines if the companion cooling coil's condenser waste heat is used to heat the regeneration inlet air. Valid choices are Yes and No. The default value is No if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Exhaust Fan Maximum Flow Rate 
ExhaustFanMaximumFlowRate
```
This optional numeric field contains the maximum fan volumetric flow rate for the exhaust fan in cubic meters per second. As noted previously, this exhaust fan is modeled internally by the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object and a separate fan object should NOT be specified in the input data file for this fan. This field is used only when a companion cooling coil is specified and the Companion Coil Regeneration Air Heating field is set to Yes . This field must be used in conjunction with the Exhaust Fan Maximum Power and the Exhaust Fan Power Curve Name input fields. The model assumes that the exhaust fan will operate as needed to maintain the Regeneration Inlet Air Setpoint Temperature , up to the maximum flow rate specified in this input field. If the desiccant dehumidifier is OFF for a simulation timestep but its companion cooling coil is operating and is specified to provide regeneration air heating, then the exhaust fan operates at this maximum air flow rate (i.e., this fan serves as the condenser fan for the companion cooling coil system when regeneration air heating is specified, so the inputs to the companion cooling coil object should not include the condenser fan energy since the condenser fan energy is modeled by the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object).
```
	
##  Field: Exhaust Fan Maximum Power 
ExhaustFanMaximumPower
```
This optional numeric field contains the maximum power for the exhaust fan in Watts (i.e., at the Exhaust Fan Maximum Flow Rate). This field is used only when a companion cooling coil is used and the Companion Coil Regeneration Air Heating field is set to Yes . This field must be used in conjunction with the Exhaust Fan Maximum Flow Rate and the Exhaust Fan Power Curve Name input fields.
```
	
##  Field: Exhaust Fan Power Curve Name 
ExhaustFanPowerCurveName
```
This optional alpha field contains the name of the exhaust fan power modifier curve. This field is used only when a companion cooling coil is used and the Companion Coil Regeneration Air Heating field is set to Yes . This field must be used in conjunction with the Exhaust Fan Maximum Flow Rate and the Exhaust Fan Maximum Power input fields. If this field is blank, the exhaust fan operates (when required) at the maximum power specified in the field above. The curve object type for this Exhaust Fan Power Curve Name must be {Curve:Cubic} or {Curve:Quadratic}. The curve object ({Curve:Cubic} or {Curve:Quadratic}) defines the change in exhaust fan power as a function of the ratio of the actual exhaust air flow rate divided by the maximum flow rate.

This is used to calculate the velocity in addition to being used directly in the frictional pressure drop calculation.
```
	
##  Field: Minor Loss Coefficient 
MinorLossCoefficient
```
This is the pressure drop coefficient typically applied to components such as fittings and occasionally heat pumps. This is parameter (K) in the equation and is dimensionless. This coefficient is used to describe the amount of dynamic pressure lost during the process. This value may be left blank if the user only wants to account for frictional losses in this branch.
```
	
##  Field: Length 
Length
```
This is the length of a pressure drop process in which friction is applied. This is parameter (L) in the equation and has units of {m}. In a pipe, this would be the length of the pipe, however in many cases, pressure drop in other components are applied as an equivalent length. This is only required if the user is wanting to perform frictional pressure drop calculations.
```
	
##  Field: Roughness 
Roughness
```
This field represents the first method to simulate frictional losses. This parameter does not appear directly in the equation above, as it is only used to develop the friction factor (f), but the roughness will have units of {m} if entered. If the user enters this roughness value, the pressure system will use it along with an approximation to the Moody chart to estimate the friction factor given the current flow conditions. This allows the friction calculate to be dynamic throughout the simulation.
```
	
##  Field: Fixed Friction Factor 
FixedFrictionFactor
```
This field represents the second method to simulate frictional losses. This is parameter (f) in the equation and is dimensionless. This parameter is a fixed value of friction factor which would override any calculations performed based on roughness, etc. If the user has a known friction factor for a given component, this is where it should be entered.

# CurveFanPressureRise

`Curve:FanPressureRise`
```
Input for the fan total pressure rise curve consists of the curve name, the four coefficients, and the maximum and minimum valid independent variable values. Optional inputs for the curve minimum and maximum may be used to limit the output of the performance curve (e.g., limit extrapolation). The equation is:
Δ {P_{fan,tot}} = {C_1}*Q_{fan}^2 + {C_2}*Q_{fan}^{} + {C_3}*Q_{fan}^{}*\sqrt {{P_{sm}} - {P_o}}  + {C_4}*\left( {{P_{sm}} - {P_o}} \right)
where Δ P_{fan,tot} is the fan total pressure rise (Pa) as a function of volumetric flow through the fan (Q_{fan}, m^3/s ), duct static pressure set point (P_{sm} , Pa), and static pressure surrounding the ducts (P_o , Pa). P_o is assumed to be zero.
The first term of the curve looks like the common system curve in which the fan pressure rise is proportional to the square of the fan flow, but here it also depends implicitly on supply and return pressure losses, and in part on the fraction of the fan flow that is outdoor air (essentially ``leaks'' into and out of the return side of the system). Very often it is the only term considered, but that would only be correct with fixed-position dampers, no distribution system leakage, no linear resistance components, and no duct static pressure control.
The second term accounts for significant flow resistances in the system where the pressure difference is linearly proportional to the flow. Some filters and coils in the return may need this term to be adequately described. This term could be ignored if there are no linear components or if their pressure drops are very small compared to the other terms.
The third term, which depends on the fan flow and square root of the supply duct pressure {P_{sm}}, accounts in part for leakage from the supply system when damper positions are fixed or are changed independently of static pressure or fan flow. In this case, reducing or eliminating supply leakage results in a different system curve. This, however, might be only a minor correction to the simple system curves generally used. The third term is zero when the VAV box dampers are modulated to control flow. Consequently, with variable-position supply dampers, reducing or eliminating supply leakage does not change the system curve.
The last term also accounts in part for leakage from the supply system when damper positions are fixed or are changed independently of static pressure or fan flow. This term indicates that the same fan pressure rise can be achieved by raising the duct pressure and closing dampers. The only change in the system in such a case is that the leakage flow may increase. The coefficient for this term is one when the VAV box dampers are modulated to control flow. In both cases, this term may be the most important correction to the simple system curves generally used, especially at low flows.

# PlantLoop

`PlantLoop`
```
The main elements of the PlantLoop syntax are described in further detail below. A map of how the input for this portion of the HVAC input fits together is provided in the following diagram.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the plant loop.
```
	
##  Field: Fluid Type 
FluidType
```
This alpha field must be a keyword selected from the list of available fluids for an EnergyPlus plant loop. Either {Water}, {Steam} or {UserDefinedFluidType} may be used. If the UserDefinedFluidType keyword is used, the following input field i.e.~User Defined Fluid Type must have a value (namely the name of a {FluidProperties:GlycolConcentration} object).
```
	
##  Field: User Defined Fluid Type 
UserDefinedFluidType
```
This alpha field must be specified when the previous field is set to {UserDefinedFluidType} otherwise it could be left blank. {Water}, {EthyleneGlycol}, {PropyleneGlycol} and {Steam} are all ``built-in'' fluids for EnergyPlus (that is, all of the appropriate properties are contained within the program). If the fluid specified here is a mixture of water and ethylene or propylene glycol, then only {FluidProperties:GlycolConcentration} objects need to be specified and the name of the appropriate one is used here. For another water/glycol mixture, a complete set of fluid property data ({FluidProperties:Name} and FluidProperties:Temperature objects plus multiple {FluidProperties:Concentration} objects for specific heat, density, etc.) must be specified (Ref dataset: GlycolPropertiesRefData.idf).
```
	
##  Field: Plant Equipment Operation Scheme Name 
PlantEquipmentOperationSchemeName
```
This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the plant operation scheme. This field ties to the {PlantEquipmentOperationSchemes} input structure, which must also be defined.
```
	
##  Field: Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name 
LoopTemperatureSetpointNodeName
```
This alpha field is used to identify the node which the Loop Manager will access the temperature setpoint that it will try to maintain. This is typically the Plant Loop Supply Side Outlet Node so that it will not interfere with component temperature setpoints. An associated temperature setpoint manager will need to be defined.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Loop Temperature 
MaximumLoopTemperature
```
This numeric field contains the maximum allowable temperature in Celsius for this loop.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Loop Temperature 
MinimumLoopTemperature
```
This numeric field contains the minimum allowable temperature in Celsius for this loop.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Loop Flow Rate 
MaximumLoopFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the maximum loop flow rate in cubic meters per second. This parameter is also used when the user chooses to autocalculate the loop volume. See Volume of the Plant Loop below and the Engineering Manual for more details. This field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Loop Flow Rate 
MinimumLoopFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the minimum loop flow rate in cubic meters per second.
```
	
##  Field: Plant Loop Volume 
PlantLoopVolume
```
Volume of the plant loop in m^{3}. This numeric field contains the loop volume for the entire loop, i.e.~both the demand side and the supply side. This is used for the loop capacitance calculation. Loop volume (m^{3}) could be calculated from pipe size data but this is not usually known. If zero volume is specified the loop has no fluid heat capacity. If a very large capacitance is specified unrealistic time delay may result and there may be poor response to changes in loop setpoint temperature. The {autocalculate} option sets the loop volume to the product of the Maximum Loop Flow Rate and the user input for Loop Circulation Time which defaults to 2 minutes (see below). This calculation is described in the Engineering Reference manual.
```
	
##  Field: Plant Side Inlet Node Name 
PlantSideInletNodeName
```

```

```
	
##  Field: Plant Side Connector List Name

This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Demand Side Branch List. The list referenced here should list all the branches on the demand side of the loop.
```
	
##  Field: Demand Side Connector List Name 
DemandSideConnectorListName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Demand Side Connector List. The list referenced here should list the splitter and mixer on the demand side of the loop.
```
	
##  Field: Load Distribution Scheme 
LoadDistributionScheme
```
The Load Distribution Scheme selects the algorithm used to sequence equipment operation in order to meet the plant loop demand. Currently, five schemes are functional:
  {Optimal} operates each piece of equipment at its optimal part load ratio. Any remaining loop demand is distributed evenly to all of the components.
  {SequentialLoad} loads each piece of equipment sequentially in the order specified in the PlantEquipmentList to its maximum part load ratio and will operate the last required piece of equipment between its minimum and maximum part load ratio in order to meet the loop demand. 
  {UniformLoad} evenly distributes the loop demand among all available components on the equipment list for a given load range. If some components do not have the capacity to meet the uniformly distributed load, the remaining load is distributed sequentially to the other available components.
  {SequentialUniformPLR} loads all equipment on the {PlantEquipmentList} to a uniform part load ratio (PLR). Components are loaded sequentially based on the order specified in the {PlantEquipmentList} until each component is fully loaded, at which point the next subsequent component is added and the load is distributed uniformly based on PLR between the components.
  {UniformPLR} will load all equipment on the {PlantEquipmentList} to a uniform part load ratio (PLR). No equipment will be loaded below its minimum PLR. If the total load is less than the sum of all equipment on the {PlantEquipmentList} operating at their respective minimum PLRs, then the last item in the equipment list is dropped and the load is distributed based on a uniform PLR for the remaining plant equipment.
Note: For all schemes, if the load for any individual component is less than the component load at the minimum PLR, the individual component model will false load or reduce duty cycle while operating at the minimum part load ratio until the load is met.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Manager List Name 
AvailabilityManagerListName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the System Availability Manager List.
```
	
##  Field: Plant Loop Demand Calculation Scheme 
PlantLoopDemandCalculationScheme
```
There are two choices for plant loop demand calculations schemes in EnergyPlus: SingleSetpoint and DualSetpointDeadband.
SingleSetpoint - For the SingleSetpoint scheme, the plant loop is controlled to a single temperature setpoint. This requires a setpoint manager with Control Variable = Temperature to place a setpoint on the Loop Temperature Setpoint Node. The setpoint will be stored in the Node%TempSetpoint variable which may be reported using {Output:Variable} System Node Setpoint Temperature. Examples of applicable setpoint managers include: {SetpointManager:Scheduled}, {SetpointManager:OutdoorAirReset}, {SetpointManager:FollowOutdoorAirTemperature}, etc. SingleSetpoint is the default.
DualSetpoint - For the DualSetpoint scheme, the plant loop is controlled to stay between a pair of high and low temperature setpoints. This requires one or two setpoint managers to place two setpoints on the Loop Temperature Setpoint Node. The setpoints will be stored in the Node%TempSetPointHi and Node%TempSetPointLo variables which may be reported using {Output:Variable} System Node Setpoint High Temperature and System Node Setpoint Low Temperature. There is special setpoint manager, {SetpointManager:Scheduled:DualSetpoint}, which will place both the high and low setpoints with Control Variable = Temperature. Otherwise, two setpoint managers are required, one with Control Variable = MaximumTemperature and another with Control Variable = MinimumTemperature. The two setpoint managers may be the same kind or different, but care should be taken so that the MinimumTemperature is not set higher than the MaximumTemperature. Examples of applicable setpoint managers include: {SetpointManager:Scheduled}, {SetpointManager:OutdoorAirReset}, {SetpointManager:FollowOutdoorAirTemperature}, etc. Note that DualSetpoint is used only for plant loops with both heating and cooling supply equipment, such as a water loop heat pump system. When the loop temperature rises above the MaximumTemperature setpoint, then the loop will request cooling, and when the loop temperature is below the MinimumTemperature setpoint it will request heating. DualSetpoint cannot be used to control a single-mode loop, such as a hot water heating loop between operating between high and low boiler setpoints.
The plant loop demand calculation scheme determines the amount of heating or cooling necessary to bring the temperature of the Plant Loop to its setpoint(s). When this value is determined then the load distribution scheme explained in the previous section takes this value and distributes the load to the appropriate equipment. The demand calculation scheme determines how the load is calculated. See more information in the Engineering Document.
```
	
##  Field: Common Pipe Simulation 
CommonPipeSimulation
```
This field specifies a primary-secondary plant loop simulation. When a common pipe option is specified, the plant side of the loop is the primary loop and the demand side of the loop is the secondary loop, and a pump object must be placed on the demand side inlet branch. The three options are ``{None}'', ``{CommonPipe}'' and ``{TwoWayCommonPipe}''. ``{None}'' means that there is no secondary loop and the plant loop is modeled as a single primary loop. ``{CommonPipe}'' means that the common pipe interface does not attempt any temperature control, it only satisfies secondary (demand side) flow requests. ``{TwoWayCommonPipe}'' allows control of the secondary (demand side) inlet temperature or the primary (plant side) inlet temperature by placing a setpoint on the corresponding node. If this field is left blank, it will default to ''None''. If the field is set to ``None'' and the program finds a pump on the demand side it will result in a fatal error.~ If the field is set to ``CommonPipe'' or ``TwoWayCommonPipe'' and the program does not find a pump on the demand side it will result in a fatal error. The common pipe simulation is currently limited to simulating loop pumps, i.e.~each pump should be placed on the inlet branch of the plant side or demand side of the loop.

PressureSimulationType
```
This field lets user to choose if this plant loop will be involved in a pressure drop calculation.~ This requires that at least one branch on the loop have pressure drop data.~ If not, an error will be thrown due to the input mismatch.~ Currently there are two pressure drop simulation types: ``PumpPowerCorrection'' and ``LoopFlowCorrection''.~ In both of these methods, branch pressure drop data is used to calculate a dynamic loop pressure drop and is used to update pumping power accordingly.~ The flow correction method allows the user to enter information regarding the pressure curve of a constant speed pump so that the simulation can dynamically resolve the pressure vs.~flow relationship in the plant loop.~ This is limited to constant speed pumps, as the variable speed pumps are expected to resolve as if it were controlled by a variable drive, so that they can inherently meet any pressure and flow demand required by the loop.~ This is also limited to ``loop pumps'', where there is a single pump on the plant loop. Common pipe simulations and ``branch pump'' simulations are not compatible with this level of pressure simulation.~ See the documentation for the {Pump:ConstantSpeed} in order to determine required inputs for this pressure simulation method to be performed.~ In the pressure drop system, parallel flow rates are not resolved (to match the pressure drop for the parallel system).~ Enhancements to this calculation are planned which will allow parallel branch flow resolution.~ See the Engineering Reference document for more information on how this works.

# CondenserLoop

`CondenserLoop`
```
The condenser loop input is very similar to that for the plant loop. As of version 7, the two loops are modeled the same way and inside the program all condenser loops are just plant loops. (In future versions of the program, this CondenserLoop object might be deprecated and these loops will be described using the {PlantLoop} object.)~ The main differences are the applicable components and operation schemes. This is depicted in the following diagram.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the condenser loop.
```
	
##  Field: Fluid Type 
FluidType
```
This alpha field must be a keyword selected from the list of available fluids for an EnergyPlus plant loop. Either {Water} or {UserDefinedFluidType} may be used. If the UserDefinedFluidType keyword is used, the following input field i.e.~User Defined Fluid Type must have a value (namely the name of a {FluidProperties:GlycolConcentration} object).
```
	
##  Field: User Defined Fluid Type 
UserDefinedFluidType
```
This alpha field must be specified when the previous field is set to {UserDefinedFluidType} otherwise it could be left blank. {Water}, {EthyleneGlycol}, and {PropyleneGlycol} are all ``built-in'' fluids for EnergyPlus (that is, all of the appropriate properties are contained within the program). If the fluid specified here is a mixture of water and ethylene or propylene glycol, then only {FluidProperties:GlycolConcentration} objects need to be specified and the name of the appropriate one is used here. For another water/glycol mixture, a complete set of fluid property data ({FluidProperties:Name} and FluidProperties:Temperature objects plus multiple {FluidProperties:Concentration} objects for specific heat, density, etc.) must be specified (Ref dataset: GlycolPropertiesRefData.idf).
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Equipment Operation Scheme Name 
CondenserEquipmentOperationSchemeName
```
This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the condenser operation scheme. This field ties to the Condenser Operation Schemes input structure, which must also be defined.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name 
CondenserLoopTemperatureSetpointNodeName
```
This alpha field is used to identify the node which the Loop Manager will access the temperature setpoint that it will try to maintain. This is typically the Condenser Loop Supply Side Outlet Node so that it will not interfere with component temperature setpoints. An associated temperature setpoint manager will need to be defined.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Loop Temperature 
MaximumLoopTemperature
```
This numeric field contains the maximum allowable temperature in Celsius for this loop.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Loop Temperature 
MinimumLoopTemperature
```
This numeric field contains the minimum allowable temperature in Celsius for this loop. This minimum loop temperature is used by the cooling towers to make sure that the minimum is not violated to keep the equipment safe. The minimum is also used to trigger the minimum temperature warning and will notify the user if it gets too low.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Loop Flow Rate 
MaximumLoopFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the maximum loop flow rate in cubic meters per second. This field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Loop Flow Rate 
MinimumLoopFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the minimum loop flow rate in cubic meters per second.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Loop Volume 
CondenserLoopVolume
```
Volume of the condenser loop in m^{3}. This numeric field contains the loop volume for the entire loop, i.e., both the demand side and the supply side. This is used for the loop capacitance calculation. Loop volume (m^{3}) could be calculated from pipe size data but this is not usually known. If zero volume is specified the loop has no fluid heat capacity. If a very large capacitance is specified unrealistic time delay may result and there may be poor response to changes in loop setpoint temperature. The {autocalculate} option sets the loop volume to the product of the Maximum Loop Flow Rate and the user input for Loop Circulation Time which defaults to 2 minutes (see below). This calculation is described in the Engineering Reference manual.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Side Inlet Node Name 
CondenserSideInletNodeName
```
This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Condenser Side Inlet Node. This node is the inlet to the supply side of the loop.
```

```
	
##  Field: Condenser Side Branch List Name 
CondenserSideBranchListName
```
This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Condenser Side Branch List. The list referenced here should list all the branches on the supply side of the loop.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Side Connector List Name 
CondenserSideConnectorListName
```
This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Condenser Side Connector List.~ The list referenced here should list the splitter and mixer on the supply side of the loop.
```

```

```

CondenserDemandSideBranchListName
```
This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Demand Side Branch List.~ The list referenced here should list all the branches on the demand side of the loop.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Demand Side Connector List Name 
CondenserDemandSideConnectorListName
```
This required alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Demand Side Connector List. The list referenced here should list the splitter and mixer on the demand side of the loop.
```
	
##  Field: Load Distribution Scheme 
LoadDistributionScheme
```
This alpha field contains the Load Distribution Scheme Keyword. The Load Distribution Scheme selects the algorithm used to sequence equipment operation in order to meet the plant loop demand. Currently, five schemes are functional. {Optimal} operates each piece of equipment at its optimal part load ratio and will operate the last component between its minimum and maximum part load ratio in order to meet the loop demand. {SequentialLoad} loads each piece of equipment sequentially in the order specified in the {PlantEquipmentList} to its maximum part load ratio and will operate the last required piece of equipment between its minimum and maximum part load ratio in order to meet the loop demand. {UniformLoad} evenly distributes the loop demand among all available components on the equipment list for a given load range. {SequentialUniformPLR} loads all equipment on the {PlantEquipmentList} to a uniform part load ratio (PLR). Components are loaded sequentially based on the order specified in the {PlantEquipmentList} until each component is fully loaded, at which point the next subsequent component is added and the load is distributed uniformly based on PLR between the components. {UniformPLR} will load all equipment on the {PlantEquipmentList} to a uniform part load ratio (PLR). No equipment will be loaded below its minimum PLR. If the total load is less than the sum of all equipment on the {PlantEquipmentList} operating at their respective minimum PLRs, then the last item in the equipment list is dropped and the load is distributed based on a uniform PLR for the remaining plant equipment.
Note: For all schemes, if the load for any individual component is less than the component load at the minimum PLR, the individual component model will false load or reduce duty cycle while operating at the minimum part load ratio until the load is met.
```
	
##  Field: Pressure Simulation Type

##  Field: Chiller Flow Mode 
ChillerFlowMode
```
This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator. ~There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:~ ``NotModulated,'' ``ConstantFlow,'' and ``LeavingSetpointModulated.''~ NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.~ ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.~ LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint at the evaporator outlet.~ For this absorption chiller, this mode also affects the flow rate on the generator connection.~ In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.~ The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.~ This flow mode does not impact the condenser loop connection.

# ChillerAbsorptionIndirect

`Chiller:Absorption:Indirect`
```
The Chiller:Absorption:Indirect object is an enhanced version of the absorption chiller model found in the Building Loads and System Thermodynamics (BLAST) program. This enhanced model is nearly identical to the existing absorption chiller model (Ref. {Chiller:Absorption}) with the exceptions that: 1) the enhanced indirect absorption chiller model provides more flexible performance curves and 2) chiller performance now includes the impact of varying evaporator, condenser, and generator temperatures. Since these absorption chiller models are nearly identical (i.e., the performance curves of the enhanced model can be manipulated to produce similar results to the previous model), it is quite probable that the {Chiller:Absorption} model will be deprecated in a future release of EnergyPlus.

##  Field: Condenser Inlet Node Name 
CondenserInletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the electric chiller condenser side inlet node. This node name is required if the chiller is WaterCooled, and optional if the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and a condenser inlet node name is specified here, the node name specified must also be specified in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an {OutdoorAir:NodeList} object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and this field is left blank, the program automatically creates an outdoor air node and the air temperature information on this node is taken directly from the weather file (no node height adjustment).

```
This numeric field contains the lower limit for the evaporator outlet temperature. This temperature acts as a cut off for heat transfer in the evaporator, so that the fluid doesn't get too cold.
```
	
##  Field: Chiller Flow Mode 
ChillerFlowMode
```
This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.~ There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:~ ``NotModulated,'' ``ConstantFlow,'' and ``LeavingSetpointModulated.''~ NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.~ ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.~ LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.~ In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.~ The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.
```
	
##  Field: Design Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate 
DesignHeatRecoveryWaterFlowRate
```
This is the design flow rate used if the heat recovery option is being simulated. If this value is greater than 0.0 then a heat recovery loop must be specified and attached to the chiller using the next 2 node fields. To determine how the heat recovery algorithm works look at the Engineering Manual at the Chiller:Electric with Heat Recovery section. The units are in cubic meters per second. This field is autosizable.~ When autosizing, the flow rate is simply the product of the design condenser flow rate and the condenser heat recovery relative capacity fraction set in the field below. Note that heat recovery is only available with Condenser Type = WaterCooled.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Recovery Inlet Node Name 
HeatRecoveryInletNodeName

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the electric chiller heat recovery side inlet node. A heat recovery loop must be specified.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name 
HeatRecoveryOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the electric chiller heat recovery side outlet node. A heat recovery loop must be specified.
```
	
##  Field: Sizing Factor 
SizingFactor
```
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity, Design Chilled Water Flow Rate and Design Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Capacity 
BasinHeaterCapacity
```
This numeric field contains the capacity of the chiller's electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the chiller is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature 
BasinHeaterSetpointTemperature
```
This numeric field contains the set point temperature (°C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the chiller is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2°C, and the default value is 2°C if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name 
BasinHeaterOperatingScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the chiller is off.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Heat Recovery Relative Capacity Fraction 
CondenserHeatRecoveryRelativeCapacityFraction
```
This field is optional.~ It can be used to describe the physical size of the heat recovery portion of a split bundle condenser section.~ This fraction describes the relative capacity of the heat recovery bundle of a split condenser compared to the nominal, full load heat rejection rate of the chiller.~ This fraction will be applied to the full heat rejection when operating at nominal capacity and nominal COP to model a capacity limit for the heat rejection.~ If this field is not entered then the capacity fraction is set to 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Recovery Inlet High Temperature Limit Schedule Name 
HeatRecoveryInletHighTemperatureLimitScheduleName
```
This field is optional.~ It can be used to control heat recovery operation of the chiller.~ The schedule named here should contain temperature values, in C, that describe an upper limit for the return fluid temperatures entering the chiller at the heat recovery inlet node.~ If the fluid temperature is too high, then the heat recovery will not operate.~ This is useful to restrict the chiller lift from becoming too high and to avoid overheating the hot water loop.~ This limit can be used with or without the alternate control using leaving setpoint that is set in the next field.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Recovery Leaving Temperature Setpoint Node Name 
HeatRecoveryLeavingTemperatureSetpointNodeName
```
This field is optional.~ It can be used to refine the model and controls for heat recovery operation of the chiller.~ The node named here should have a setpoint placed on it by a setpoint manager.~ If the plant loop's demand calculation scheme is set to SingleSetpoint, then a single setpoint manager should be used.~ If the plant loop's demand calculation is set to DualSetpointDeadband then a dual setpoint manager should be used and the upper setpoint is used for control.~ When this field is used, a different model is used for determining the distribution of rejected heat between the two bundles that is more appropriate for series bundle arrangements and for chiller's that are able to produce relatively higher temperature heated fluids.
```
	
##  Field: End-Use Subcategory 
EndUseSubcategory
```
This optional field allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Process''. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref: {Output:Meter} objects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the chiller will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

# ChillerElectricEIR

`Chiller:Electric:EIR`
```
This chiller model is the empirical model used in the DOE-2.1 building energy simulation program. The model uses performance information at reference conditions along with three curve fits for cooling capacity and efficiency to determine chiller operation at off-reference conditions. Chiller performance curves can be generated by fitting manufacturer's catalog data or measured data. Performance curves for more than 160 chillers, including the default DOE-2.1E reciprocating and centrifugal chillers, are provided in the EnergyPlus Reference DataSets (Chillers.idf and AllDataSets.idf).
Note: Chiller:Electric:EIR objects and their associated performance curve objects are developed using performance information for a specific chiller and should normally be used together for an EnergyPlus simulation. Changing the object input values, or swapping performance curves between chillers, should be done with caution.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the electric EIR chiller.
```
	
##  Field: Reference Capacity 
ReferenceCapacity
```
This numeric field contains the reference cooling capacity of the chiller in Watts. This should be the capacity of the chiller at the reference temperatures and water flow rates defined below. Alternately, this field can be autosized.
```
	
##  Field: Reference COP 
ReferenceCOP
```
This numeric field contains the chiller's coefficient of performance. This value should {not} include energy use due to pumps or cooling tower fans. This COP should be at the reference temperatures and water flow rates defined below. This value {should} include evap-cooled or air-cooled condenser fans except when the Condenser Fan Power Ratio input field defined below is used and that input value is greater than 0. For the case when condenser fan power is modeled separately, the calculated condenser fan energy is reported on the same electric meter as compressor power. Be careful to not duplicate this energy use.
```
	
##  Field: Reference Leaving Chilled Water Temperature 
ReferenceLeavingChilledWaterTemperature
```
This numeric field contains the chiller's reference leaving chilled water temperature in Celsius. The default value is 6.67°C.
```
	
##  Field: Reference Entering Condenser Fluid Temperature 
ReferenceEnteringCondenserFluidTemperature
```
This numeric field contains the chiller's reference entering condenser fluid temperature in Celsius. The default value is 29.4°C. For water-cooled chillers this is the water temperature entering the condenser (e.g., leaving the cooling tower). For air- or evap-cooled condensers this is the entering outdoor air dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperature, respectively.
```
	
##  Field: Reference Chilled Water Flow Rate 
ReferenceChilledWaterFlowRate
```
For a variable flow chiller this is the maximum water flow rate and for a constant flow chiller this is the operating water flow rate through the chiller's evaporator. The units are in cubic meters per second. The minimum value for this numeric input field must be greater than zero, or this field can be autosized.
```
	
##  Field: Reference Condenser Fluid Flow Rate 
ReferenceCondenserFluidFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the chiller's operating condenser fluid flow rate in cubic meters per second. This field can be autosized. This field is also used to enter the air flow rate if Condenser Type = AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and Heat Recovery is specified. If AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and this field is autosized, the air flow rate is set to 0.000114 m3/s/W (850 cfm/ton) multiplied by the chiller Reference Capacity. For air- and evaporatively-cooled condensers, this flow rate is used to set condenser outlet air node conditions and used for evaporatively-cooled condensers to calculate water use rate.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name 
CoolingCapacityFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the cooling capacity as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the entering condenser fluid temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference capacity to give the cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.
Note: The curve is evaluated at the leaving chilled water (=evaporator outlet) {setpoint} temperature, not the {actual} leaving chilled water temperature.
```
	
##  Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name 
ElectricInputToCoolingOutputRatioFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the entering condenser fluid temperature. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference EIR (inverse of the reference COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.
```
	
##  Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Name 
ElectricInputToCoolingOutputRatioFunctionOfPartLoadRatioCurveName
```
The name of a quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the part-load ratio (EIRfTPLR). The EIR is the inverse of the COP, and the part-load ratio is the actual cooling load divided by the chiller's available cooling capacity. This curve is generated by dividing the operating electric input power by the available full-load capacity (do not divide by load) at the specific operating temperatures. The curve output should decrease from 1 towards 0 as part-load ratio decreases from 1 to 0. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference full-load EIR (inverse of the reference COP) and the Energy Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve to give the EIR at the specific temperatures and part-load ratio at which the chiller is operating. This curve should have a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0. An ideal chiller with the same efficiency at all part-load ratio's would use a performance curve that has a value of 0 when the part-load ratio equals 0 (i.;e., a line connecting 0,0 and 1,1 when plotted as EIRfTPLR versus PLR), however, actual systems can have part-load EIR's slightly above or below this line (i.e., part-load efficiency often differs from rated efficiency). The quadratic curve should be valid for the range of part-load ratios anticipated for the simulation.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Part Load Ratio 
MinimumPartLoadRatio
```
This numeric field contains the chiller's minimum part-load ratio. The expected range is between 0 and 1. Below this part-load ratio, the compressor cycles on and off to meet the cooling load. The Minimum Part Load Ratio must be less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 0.1.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Part Load Ratio 
MaximumPartLoadRatio
```
This numeric field contains the chiller's maximum part-load ratio. This value may exceed 1, but the normal range is between 0 and 1.0. The Maximum Part Load Ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Optimum Part Load Ratio 
OptimumPartLoadRatio
```
This numeric field contains the chiller's optimum part-load ratio. This is the part-load ratio at which the chiller performs at its maximum COP. The optimum part-load ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio, and less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Unloading Ratio 
MinimumUnloadingRatio
```
This numeric field contains the chiller's minimum unloading ratio. The expected range is between 0 and 1. The minimum unloading ratio is where the chiller capacity can no longer be reduced by unloading and must be false loaded to meet smaller cooling loads. A typical false loading strategy is hot-gas bypass. The minimum unloading ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio, and less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 0.2.
```
	
##  Field: Chilled Water Inlet Node Name 
ChilledWaterInletNodeName

```
	
##  Field: Condenser Inlet Node Name 
CondenserInletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller condenser side inlet node. This node name is required if the chiller is WaterCooled, and optional if the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and a condenser inlet node name is specified here, the node name specified must also be specified in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an {OutdoorAir:NodeList} object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and this field is left blank, the program automatically creates an outdoor air node and the air temperature information on this node is taken directly from the weather file (no node height adjustment).
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Outlet Node Name 
CondenserOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller condenser side outlet node. This node name is required if the chiller is WaterCooled, and optional if the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and this field is left blank, the program automatically creates a condenser side outlet air node.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Type 
CondenserType
```
This alpha field determines what type of condenser will be modeled with this chiller. Valid condenser types are AirCooled, WaterCooled, and EvaporativelyCooled with the default being WaterCooled if not specified. AirCooled and EvaporativelyCooled do not require a Condenser Loop to be specified, whereas the WaterCooled option requires the full specification of the Condenser Loop and its associated equipment.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Fan Power Ratio 
CondenserFanPowerRatio
```
This field is used to model condenser fan power associated with air-cooled or evaporatively-cooled condensers (for cooling towers, refer to Group - Condenser Equipment). Enter the ratio of the condenser fan power to the reference chiller cooling capacity in W/W. If this input is greater than 0, the condenser fan power is modeled seperatly from compressor power. In addition, if condenser fan power is modeled using this input, the reference COP and ``Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of'' performance curves should not include condenser fan power.
```
	
##  Field: Fraction of Compressor Electric Power Rejected by Condenser 
FractionOfCompressorElectricPowerRejectedByCondenser
```
This numeric input represents the fraction of compressor electrical energy consumption that must be rejected by the condenser. Enter a value of 1.0 when modeling hermetic chillers. For open chillers, enter the compressor motor efficiency. This value must be greater than 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0, with a default value of 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Leaving Chilled Water Lower Temperature Limit 
LeavingChilledWaterLowerTemperatureLimit
```
This numeric field contains the lower limit for the leaving chilled water temperature in Celsius. This temperature acts as a cut off for heat transfer in the evaporator, so that the fluid doesn't get too cold. This input field is currently unused. The default value is 2°C.
```
	
##  Field: Chiller Flow Mode 
ChillerFlowMode
```
This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.~ There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:~ ``NotModulated,'' ``ConstantFlow,'' and ``LeavingSetpointModulated.''~ NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.~ ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.~ LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.~ In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.~ The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.
```
	
##  Field: Design Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate 
DesignHeatRecoveryWaterFlowRate
```
This is the design heat recovery water flow rate if the heat recovery option is being simulated. If this value is greater than 0.0 (or Autosize), a heat recovery loop must be specified and attached to the chiller using the next two node fields. The units are in cubic meters per second.~ This field is autosizable.~ When autosizing, the flow rate is simply the product of the design condenser flow rate and the condenser heat recovery relative capacity fraction set in the field below. Note that heat recovery is only available with Condenser Type = WaterCooled.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Recovery Inlet Node Name 
HeatRecoveryInletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller heat recovery side inlet node. If the user wants to model chiller heat recovery, a heat recovery loop must be specified.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name 
HeatRecoveryOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller heat recovery side outlet node. If the user wants to model chiller heat recovery, a heat recovery loop must be specified.
```
	
##  Field: Sizing Factor 
SizingFactor
```
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Reference Capacity, Reference Chilled Water Flow Rate and Reference Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Capacity 
BasinHeaterCapacity
```
This numeric field contains the capacity of the chiller's electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the chiller is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature 
BasinHeaterSetpointTemperature
```
This numeric field contains the set point temperature (°C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the chiller is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2°C, and the default value is 2°C if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name 
BasinHeaterOperatingScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the chiller is off.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Heat Recovery Relative Capacity Fraction 
CondenserHeatRecoveryRelativeCapacityFraction
```
This field is optional.~ It can be used to describe the physical size of the heat recovery portion of a split bundle condenser section.~ This fraction describes the relative capacity of the heat recovery bundle of a split condenser compared to the nominal, full load heat rejection rate of the chiller.~ This fraction will be applied to the full heat rejection when operating at nominal capacity and nominal COP to model a capacity limit for the heat rejection.~ If this field is not entered then the capacity fraction is set to 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Recovery Inlet High Temperature Limit Schedule Name 
HeatRecoveryInletHighTemperatureLimitScheduleName
```
This field is optional.~ It can be used to control heat recovery operation of the chiller.~ The schedule named here should contain temperature values, in C, that describe an upper limit for the return fluid temperatures entering the chiller at the heat recovery inlet node.~ If the fluid temperature is too high, then the heat recovery will not operate.~ This is useful to restrict the chiller lift from becoming too high and to avoid overheating the hot water loop.~ This limit can be used with or without the alternate control using leaving setpoint that is set in the next field.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Recovery Leaving Temperature Setpoint Node Name 
HeatRecoveryLeavingTemperatureSetpointNodeName
```
This field is optional.~ It can be used to refine the model and controls for heat recovery operation of the chiller.~ The node named here should have a setpoint placed on it by a setpoint manager.~ If the plant loop's demand calculation scheme is set to SingleSetpoint, then a single setpoint manager should be used.~ If the plant loop's demand calculation is set to DualSetpointDeadband then a dual setpoint manager should be used and the upper setpoint is used for control.~ When this field is used, a different model is used for determining the distribution of rejected heat between the two bundles that is more appropriate for series bundle arrangements and for chiller's that are able to produce relatively higher temperature heated fluilds.
```
	
##  Field: End-Use Subcategory 
EndUseSubcategory
```
This optional field allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Process''. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref: {Output:Meter} objects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the chiller will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

# ChillerElectricReformulatedEIR

`Chiller:Electric:ReformulatedEIR`
```
This chiller model, developed through the CoolTools\textsuperscript{TM} project sponsored by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG\&E), is an empirical model similar to EnergyPlus' {Chiller:Electric:EIR} model. The model uses performance information at reference conditions along with three curve fits for cooling capacity and efficiency to determine chiller operation at off-reference conditions. The model has the same capabilities as the {Chiller:Electric:EIR} model, but can potentially provide significant accuracy improvement over the {Chiller:Electric:EIR} model for variable-speed compressor drive and variable condenser water flow applications. Chiller performance curves can be generated by fitting manufacturer's catalog data or measured data. Performance curves developed from manufacturer's performance data are provided in the EnergyPlus Reference DataSets (Chillers.idf and AllDataSets.idf). This chiller model can be used to predict the performance of various chiller types (e.g., reciprocating, screw, scroll, and centrifugal) with water-cooled condensers.
The main difference between this model and the {Chiller:Electric:EIR} model is the condenser fluid temperature used in the associated performance curves: the Chiller:Electric:ReformulatedEIR model uses the LEAVING condenser water temperature while the {Chiller:Electric:EIR} model uses the ENTERING condenser water temperature.
Note: Chiller:Electric:Reformulated EIR objects and their associated performance curve objects are developed using performance information for a specific chiller and should almost always be used together for an EnergyPlus simulation. Changing the object input values, or swapping performance curves between chillers, should be done with extreme caution. For example, if the user wishes to model a chiller size that is different from the reference capacity, it is highly recommended that the reference flow rates be scaled proportionately to the change in reference capacity. Although this model can provide more accurate prediction than the {Chiller:Electric:EIR} model, it requires more performance data to develop the associated performance curves (at least 12 points from full-load performance and 7 points from part-load performance).

```
	
##  Field: Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name 
CoolingCapacityFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the cooling capacity as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the leaving condenser water temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference capacity to give the cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation (otherwise the program issues warning messages).
```
	
##  Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name 
ElectricInputToCoolingOutputRatioFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
The name of the Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve. Valid curve object types are {Curve:Quadratic} or {Table:Lookup}. The performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the leaving condenser water temperature. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference EIR (inverse of the reference COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve or the {Table:Lookup} should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation (otherwise the program issues warning messages).
```
	
##  Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Type 
ElectricInputToCoolingOutputRatioFunctionOfPartLoadRatioCurveType
```
This choice field determines which type of the Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve is used in the chiller modeling. Two curve types are available: (1) Type LeavingCondenserWaterTemperature is based on the leaving condenser water temperature. (2) Type Lift is based on the normalized lift, which is the temperature difference between the leaving condenser water temperature and the leaving evaporator water temperature.
```
	
##  Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Name 
ElectricInputToCoolingOutputRatioFunctionOfPartLoadRatioCurveName
```
The name of performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving condenser water temperature and the part-load ratio (EIRfTPLR). The form of this curve is based on the input for Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Type.
For the type of LeavingCondenserWaterTemperature, the curve object type should be {Curve:Bicubic} or {Table:Lookup} that parameterizes
the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the leaving condenser water temperature.
For the type of Lift, the curve object type should be {Curve:ChillerPartLoadWithLift} or {Table:Lookup} that parameterizes the variation of EIR
as a function of the normalized fractional Lift, normalized Tdev and the PLR. Tdev is the difference between Leaving Chilled Water Temperature and Reference Chilled Water Temperature.
Lift is the difference between the Leaving Condenser Water Temperature and Leaving Chilled Water Temperature.
The EIR is the inverse of the COP, and the part-load ratio is the actual cooling load divided by the chiller's available cooling capacity.
This curve is generated by dividing the operating electric input power by the available full-load capacity (do not divide by load) at the specific operating temperatures.
The curve output should decrease from 1 towards 0 as part-load ratio decreases from 1 to 0.
The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference full-load EIR (inverse of the reference COP) and the Energy Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve
to give the EIR at the specific temperatures and part-load ratio at which the chiller is operating.
This curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference leaving condenser water temperature with the part-load ratio equal to 1.0.
An ideal chiller with the same efficiency at all part-load ratio's would use a performance curve that has a value of 0 when the part-load ratio equals 0
(i.;e., a line connecting 0,0 and 1,1 when plotted as EIRfTPLR versus PLR), however, actual systems can have part-load EIR's slightly above or below this line
(i.e., part-load efficiency often differs from rated efficiency). The bicubic curve should be valid for the range of condenser water temperatures
and part-load ratios anticipated for the simulation (otherwise the program issues warning messages).
Note: Although a bicubic curve requires 10 coefficients (ref. {Curve:Bicubic}), coefficients 7, 9 and 10 are typically not used in the performance curve described here and should be entered as 0 unless sufficient performance data and regression accuracy exist to justify the use of these coefficients. Additionally, coefficients 2, 3, and 6 should not be used unless sufficient temperature data is available to accurately define the performance curve (i.e., negative values may result from insufficient data).
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Part Load Ratio 
MinimumPartLoadRatio
```
This numeric field contains the chiller's minimum part-load ratio. The expected range is between 0 and 1. Below this part-load ratio, the compressor cycles on and off to meet the cooling load. The Minimum Part Load Ratio must be less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 0.1.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Part Load Ratio 
MaximumPartLoadRatio
```
This numeric field contains the chiller's maximum part-load ratio. This value may exceed 1, but the normal range is between 0 and 1.0. The Maximum Part Load Ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Optimum Part Load Ratio 
OptimumPartLoadRatio
```
This numeric field contains the chiller's optimum part-load ratio. This is the part-load ratio at which the chiller performs at its maximum COP. The optimum part-load ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio, and less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Unloading Ratio 
MinimumUnloadingRatio
```
This numeric field contains the chiller's minimum unloading ratio. The expected range is between 0 and 1. The minimum unloading ratio is where the chiller capacity can no longer be reduced by unloading and must be false loaded to meet smaller cooling loads. A typical false loading strategy is hot-gas bypass. The minimum unloading ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio, and less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 0.2.
```

##  Field: Fraction of Compressor Electric Power Rejected by Condenser 
FractionOfCompressorElectricPowerRejectedByCondenser
```
This numeric input represents the fraction of compressor electrical energy consumption that must be rejected by the condenser. Enter a value of 1.0 when modeling hermetic chillers. For open chillers, enter the compressor motor efficiency. This value must be greater than 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0, with a default value of 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Leaving Chilled Water Lower Temperature Limit 
LeavingChilledWaterLowerTemperatureLimit
```
This numeric field contains the lower limit for the leaving chilled water temperature in Celsius. This temperature acts as a cut off for heat transfer in the evaporator, so that the water doesn't get too cold. This input field is currently unused. The default value is 2°C.
```
	
##  Field: Chiller Flow Mode Type 
ChillerFlowModeType
```
This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.~ There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:~ ``NotModulated,'' ``ConstantFlow,'' and ``LeavingSetpointModulated.''~ NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.~ ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.~ LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.~ In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.~ The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.
```
	
##  Field: Design Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate 
DesignHeatRecoveryWaterFlowRate
```
This is the design heat recovery water flow rate if the heat recovery option is being simulated. If this value is greater than 0.0 (or autosize), a heat recovery loop must be specified and attached to the chiller using the next two node fields. The units are in cubic meters per second.~ This field is autosizable.~ When autosizing, the flow rate is simply the product of the design condenser flow rate and the condenser heat recovery relative capacity fraction set in the field below.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Recovery Inlet Node Name 
HeatRecoveryInletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller heat recovery side inlet node. If the user wants to model chiller heat recovery, a heat recovery loop must be specified and it can only be used with a water-cooled condenser.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name 
HeatRecoveryOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller heat recovery side outlet node. If the user wants to model chiller heat recovery, a heat recovery loop must be specified and it can only be used with a water-cooled condenser.
```
	
##  Field: Sizing Factor 
SizingFactor
```
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Reference Capacity, Reference Chilled Water Flow Rate and Reference Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Heat Recovery Relative Capacity Fraction 
CondenserHeatRecoveryRelativeCapacityFraction
```
This field is optional.~ It can be used to describe the physical size of the heat recovery portion of a split bundle condenser section.~ This fraction describes the relative capacity of the heat recovery bundle of a split condenser compared to the nominal, full load heat rejection rate of the chiller.~ This fraction will be applied to the full heat rejection when operating at nominal capacity and nominal COP to model a capacity limit for the heat rejection.~ If this field is not entered then the capacity fraction is set to 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Recovery Inlet High Temperature Limit Schedule Name 
HeatRecoveryInletHighTemperatureLimitScheduleName
```
This field is optional.~ It can be used to control heat recovery operation of the chiller.~ The schedule named here should contain temperature values, in C, that describe an upper limit for the return fluid temperatures entering the chiller at the heat recovery inlet node.~ If the fluid temperature is too high, then the heat recovery will not operate.~ This is useful to restrict the chiller lift from becoming too high and to avoid overheating the hot water loop.~ This limit can be used with or without the alternate control using leaving setpoint that is set in the next field.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Recovery Leaving Temperature Setpoint Node Name 
HeatRecoveryLeavingTemperatureSetpointNodeName
```
This field is optional.~ It can be used to refine the model and controls for heat recovery operation of the chiller.~ The node named here should have a setpoint placed on it by a setpoint manager.~ If the plant loop's demand calculation scheme is set to SingleSetpoint, then a single setpoint manager should be used.~ If the plant loop's demand calculation is set to DualSetpointDeadband then a dual setpoint manager should be used and the upper setpoint is used for control.~ When this field is used, a different model is used for determining the distribution of rejected heat between the two bundles that is more appropriate for series bundle arrangements and for chiller's that are able to produce relatively higher temperature heated fluilds.
```
	
##  Field: End-Use Subcategory 
EndUseSubcategory
```
This optional field allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Process''. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref: {Output:Meter} objects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the chiller will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.~ There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:~ ``NotModulated,'' ``ConstantFlow,'' and ``LeavingSetpointModulated.''~ NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.~ ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.~ LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.~ In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.~ The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Temperature for Heat Recovery at Heat Recovery Outlet Node 
MaximumTemperatureForHeatRecoveryAtHeatRecoveryOutletNode
```
This field sets the maximum temperature that this piece of equipment can produce for heat recovery. The idea behind this field is that the current models do not take temperatures into account for availability and they just pass Q's around the loop without a temperature limit. This temperature limit puts an upper bound on the recovered heat and limits the max temperatures leaving the component.
As temperatures in the loop approach the maximum temperature, the temperature difference between the entering water and the surfaces in the piece of equipment becomes smaller. For the given heat recovery flow rate and that temperature difference the amount of heat recovered will be reduced, and eventually there will be no heat recovered when the entering water temperature is equal to the maximum temperature specified by the user in this field. The reduced amount of heat recovered will diminish if the temperature of the loop approach is the maximum temperature, and this will show up in the reporting. This allows the user to set the availability or the quality of the heat recovered for usage in other parts of the system or to heat domestic hot water supply. The temperature is specified in degrees C.
```

Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

```
	
##  Field: Condenser Heat Recovery Relative Capacity Fraction

This fraction will be applied to the full heat rejection when operating at nominal capacity and nominal COP to model a capacity limit for the heat rejection. If this field is not entered then the capacity fraction is set to 1.0.

##  Field: Chiller Flow Mode 
ChillerFlowMode
```
This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.~ There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:~ ``NotModulated,'' ``ConstantFlow,'' and ``LeavingSetpointModulated.''~ NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.~ ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.~ LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.~ In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.~ The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.
```
	
##  Field: Fuel Type

```
	
##  Field: Heat Recovery Maximum Temperature 
HeatRecoveryMaximumTemperature
```
This field sets the maximum temperature that this piece of equipment can produce for heat recovery.~ The idea behind this field is that the current models do not take temperatures into account for availability and they just pass Q's around the loop without a temperature limit.~ This temperature limit puts an upper bound on the recovered heat and limits the max temperatures leaving the component.
As temperatures in the loop approach the maximum temperature, the temperature difference between the entering water and the surfaces in the piece of equipment becomes smaller.~ For the given heat recovery flow rate and that temperature difference the amount of heat recovered will be reduced, and eventually there will be no heat recovered when the entering water temperature is equal to the maximum temperature specified by the user in this field.~ The reduced amount of heat recovered will diminish if the temperature of the loop approach is the maximum temperature, and this will show up in the reporting.~ This allows the user to set the availability or the quality of the heat recovered for usage in other parts of the system or to heat domestic hot water supply.
The temperature is specified in degrees C.
```

For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity, Design Chilled Water Flow Rate and Design Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name 
BasinHeaterOperatingScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled.

```

# ChillerHeaterAbsorptionDirectFired

`ChillerHeater:Absorption:DirectFired`
```
This chiller is a direct fired absorption chiller-heater which is modeled using performance curves similar to the equivalent chiller in DOE-2.1E. This type of chiller is unusual for EnergyPlus, because it may be used in the same plant on both a chilled water supply branch and a hot water supply branch. The chiller has six node connections for chilled water, condenser water, and hot water, and can provide simultaneous heating and cooling. During simultaneous operation, the heating capacity is reduced as the cooling load increases (for more details see below). Some equations are provided below to help explain the function of the various performance curves. For a detailed description of the algorithm and how the curves are used in the calculations, please see the Engineering Reference.

# ChillerHeaterAbsorptionDoubleEffect

`ChillerHeater:Absorption:DoubleEffect`
```
This chiller is an exhaust fired absorption chiller-heater which is modeled using performance curves similar to the direct fired absorption chiller in DOE-2.1E. The model uses the exhaust gas output from MicroTurbine. This type of chiller is unusual for EnergyPlus, because it may be used in the same plant on both a chilled water supply branch and a hot water supply branch. The chiller has six node connections for chilled water, condenser water, and hot water, and can provide simultaneous heating and cooling. During simultaneous operation, the heating capacity is reduced as the cooling load increases (for more details see below). Some equations are provided below to help explain the function of the various performance curves. For a detailed description of the algorithm and how the curves are used in the calculations, please see the Engineering Reference.

# BoilerHotWater

`Boiler:HotWater`
```
The boiler model calculates the performance of fuel oil, gas and electric boilers. Boiler performance is based on nominal thermal efficiency. A normailized efficiency performance curve may be used to more accurately represent the performance of non-electric boilers but is not considered a required input. When using the normalized efficiency performance curve, if all coefficients are not required simply set the unused coefficients to 0. For example, an electric boiler could be modeled by setting the nominal thermal efficiency to a value in the range of 0.96 to 1.0. Coefficient A0 in the normalized efficiency performance curve would equal 1 and all other coefficients would be set to 0. Coefficients for other types of non-electric boilers would set a combination of the available coefficents to non-zero values.

```
	
##  Field: Nominal capacity

This numeric field contains the nominal operating capacity (W) of the boiler. The boiler may be autosized and would require a heating plant sizing object.

```
	
##  Field: Nominal Thermal Efficiency 
NominalThermalEfficiency
```
This required numeric field contains the heating efficiency (as a fraction between 0 and 1) of the boiler's burner.~ This is the efficiency relative to the higher heating value (HHV) of fuel at a part load ratio of 1.0. Manufacturers typically specify the efficiency of a boiler using the higher heating value of the fuel. For the rare occurences when a manufacturers (or particular data set) thermal efficiency is based on the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel, multiply the thermal efficiency by the lower-to-higher heating value ratio. For example, assume a fuel's lower and higher heating values are approximately 45,450 and 50,000 kJ/kg, respectively. For a manuracturers thermal effiency rating of 0.90 (based on the LHV), the nominal thermal efficiency entered here is 0.82 (i.e.~0.9 multiplied by 45,450/50,000).

```
	
##  Field: Normalized Boiler Efficiency Curve Name 
NormalizedBoilerEfficiencyCurveName
```
This alpha field contains the curve name which describes the normalized heating efficiency (as a fraction of nominal thermal efficiency) of the boiler's burner. If this field is left blank, the nominal thermal efficiency is assumed to be constant (i.e., Fuel Used is equal to the Theoretical Fuel Use in the equation above). When a boiler efficiency curve is used, the curve may be any valid curve object with 1 (PLR) or 2 (PLR and boiler outlet water temperature) independent variables. A tri-quadratic curve object is not allowed since it uses 3 independent variables. The linear, quadratic, and cubic curve types may be used when the boiler efficiency is solely a function of boiler part-load ratio (PLR). When this type of curve is used, the boiler should operate at (or very near) the design boiler water outlet temperature. Other curve types may be used when the boiler efficiency is a function of both PLR and boiler water temperature. Examples of valid single and dual independent variable equations are shown below. For all curve types PLR is always the x independent variable. When using 2 independent variables, the boiler outlet water temperature (Toutlet) is always the y independent variable.

##  Field: Boiler Flow Mode 
BoilerFlowMode
```
This choice field determines how the boiler operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device.~ There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:~ ``NotModulated,'' ``ConstantFlow,'' and ``LeavingSetpointModulated.''~ NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the boiler is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.~ ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the boiler's request for flow is more strict and can increase the overall loop flow.~ LeavingSetpointModulated changes the boiler model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the boiler matches a setpoint.~ In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the boiler -- for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.~~ The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.
```
	
##  Field: Parasitic Electric Load

# BoilerSteam

`Boiler:Steam`
```
The steam boiler model provides a first order approximation of performance for fuel oil, gas and electric boilers. Boiler performance is based on a ``theoretical'' boiler efficiency (overall efficiency at design operating conditions) and a single quadratic fuel use/ part load ratio curve. This single curve accounts for all combustion inefficiencies and stack losses.

# PlantLoopHeatPumps

`Plant Loop Heat Pumps`
```
EnergyPlus has four plant loop heat pump models: parameter estimation (water-source only), equation fit (water-source only), EIR-formulated (water or air source), and fuel-fired absorption (air-source only).
{{HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Cooling}}
{{HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Heating}}
This model is an equation-fit model from the catalog data which resembles a black box with no usage of heat transfer equations. The performance of the heat pump is modeled using curves fitted from the catalog data.
{{HeatPump:WaterToWater:ParameterEstimation:Cooling}}
{{HeatPump:WaterToWater:ParameterEstimation:Heating}}
This model is a parameter estimation based model that uses physical parameters generated from the catalog data. The physical parameters are then used to predict the performance of the heat pump using thermodynamic laws and heat transfer equations. The heat pump has a reciprocating compressor that serves both the hot water and the chilled water loop. Note that this model is currently ``hardwired'' to fluid property R22. FluidProperties:* objects for R-22 must be included in the idf file. These may be copied from DataSets\\FluidPropertiesRefData.idf.
Descriptions and strengths of these two models are available in the following references:
Jin, Hui. 2002. Parameter Estimation Based Models of Water Source Heat Pumps. Phd. Thesis, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Oklahoma State University. (downloadable from \href{http://www.hvac.okstate.edu}{http://www.hvac.okstate.edu/})

{{HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:Cooling}}
{{HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:Heating}}
Beginning with version 9.1, an EIR-formulated heat pump model was added. This heat pump can be operated as a water-source object with the source-side connected to another plant loop, or as an air-source object with the source-side interacting with the outdoor air. This formulation allows the user to enter curves for specifying the capacity and energy usage in a more generic way, allowing the curves to be applicable to a wide variety of components. With the original equation fit model, the curve form was locked in to a specific set of linear coefficients. With the new form, the curve can be a quadratic function of temperatures, or an even more generic lookup table.
{{HeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Cooling}}
{{HeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Heating}}
This is a fuel-fired air-to-water absorption cycle heat pump.
{Configuration}
The Supply side of the heat pump is usually connected to a Ground Heat Exchanger for a water-source object. The figure below shows the layout and piping diagram of the water-to-water heat pump.
    
    
    
First, the equation fit model objects are described. This model has two sets of coefficients, one for the heating mode and other for the cooling mode.

This numeric field is the design electric power consumption for cooling, in W. This corresponds to the electic power use at the Reference Cooling Capacity. This field is autosizable. When autosized, the field called Reference Coefficient of Performance must be used.
```
	
##  Fields: Cooling Capacity Curve Name 
sCoolingCapacityCurveName
```
This alpha field specifies the name of a {quadlinear} performance curve object (ref: Performance Curves) for the Cooling Capacity curve. More details on how these coefficients in the curve are used are described in the Engineering Reference.

```
This field is required if the Reference Cooling Power Consumption is set to autosize. The nominal COP is defined by the Reference Cooling Capacity divided by the corresponding Reference Cooling Power Consumption and is non-dimensional. This field is only used for sizing; if the Reference Power Consumption is set to a fixed value then the COP of the component during simulation will be determined by the ratio of Reference Cooling Capacity divided by the corresponding Reference Cooling Power Consumption and not by the value in this field. This COP does not include power for fluid circulation pumps, it is just the heat pump itself.
```
	
##  Field: Sizing Factor 
SizingFactor
```
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The
sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations
are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component
the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Reference Load Side Flow Rate, Reference Source Side Flow Rate, Reference Cooling Capacity, and Reference Cooling Power Consumption. The Sizing Factor allows the user to size
a component to meet part of the plant loop's design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature. For example if there are two heat pumps on the supply side, each one could be sized to be half of the design load.
```
	
##  Field: Companion Heating Heat Pump Name 
CompanionHeatingHeatPumpName
```
This optional name field allows the user to specify the companion heating water to water heat pump for this cooling component. This should be the name of an {HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Heating} object defined elsewhere in the input file. Because the cooling and heating models are often intended to represent separate operating modes of one single reversible heat pump, it is useful to identify the corresponding heating heat pump input object by name. This is currently used with autosizing so that the sizing calculations can be coordinated so that the two companion heat pumps get the same design reference flow rates.

The name of the water inlet node connection. For the heating mode, this will be likely the incoming DHW water node. For the cooling mode, this will be the chilled water inlet node.
Note that here the ``water'' does not have to be literally mean ``water''. Rather it is the working fluid in the connected water side plant loop, which is can be some kind of glycol-water solution as well.
```
	
##  Field: Water Outlet Node Name

```
	
##  Field: Companion Cooling Heat Pump Name 
CompanionCoolingHeatPumpName
```
This optional name field allows the user to specify the companion cooling water to water heat pump for this heating component. This should be the name of an HeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Cooling object defined elsewhere in the input file. Because the cooling and heating models are often intended to represent separate operating modes of one single reversible heat pump, it is useful to identify the corresponding cooling heat pump input object by name. This is currently used with autosizing so that the sizing calculations can be coordinated so that the two companion heat pumps get the same design reference flow rates.
For HeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Cooling object, this field name will be ``Companion Heating Heat Pump Name'' instead.
```
	
##  Field: Fuel Type 
FuelType

```
	
##  Field: Design Temperature Lift 
DesignTemperatureLift
```
The design temperature difference between the outlet water node and the inlet water node, in degree [C]. The default value is 11.1°C. For the HeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Heating object, this is a temperature rise; and for HeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Cooling object, this is a temperature drop.
```
	
##  Field: Sizing Factor 
SizingFactor
```
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity and Design Flow Rate. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.
```
	
##  Field: Flow Mode 
FlowMode
```
This choice field determines how the gas-fired absorption heat pump operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device. There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior: ``NotModulated'', ``ConstantFlow'', and ``LeavingSetpointModulated''. {NotModulated} is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the boiler is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates. {ConstantFlow} is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the heat pump's request for flow is more strict and can increase the overall loop flow. {LeavingSetpointModulated} changes the heat pump model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the heat pump matches a setpoint. In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the heat pump---for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met. The default, if not specified, is {NotModulated}.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Temperature Curve Input Variable 
OutdoorAirTemperatureCurveInputVariable
```

Manufacturers express the performance of their heat pumps using either the leaving condenser water temperature or the entering condenser water temperature. Valid choices for this field are: ``LeavingCondenser'' or ``EnteringCondenser''. It is important that the performance curves and this field are consistent with each other. The default is {EnteringCondenser}.
For HeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Cooling object, the choices for this field should be the ``LeavingEvaporator'' and ``EnteringEvaporator''.
```
	
##  Field: Normalized Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name 
NormalizedCapacityFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
This field is the curve name of the normalized capacity function of the two independent temperature variables. The maximum capacity is adjusted from the rated conditions, and represents what the actual capacity the heat pump can achieve under the outdoor air temperature (either drybulb or wetbuld depending on the previous input field choice), and the water temperature (either leaving condenser/evaporator or entering condenser/evaporator depending on the previous input field choice).

If greater than 1.0, the equipment is typically thought of as capable of being overloaded. The default is 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Defrost Control Type 
DefrostControlType
```
The defrost control type. There are two options for this input: {Timed}, or {OnDemand}. The {Timed} option will use a fraction of time per hour to account for the defrost action. The {OnDemand} option will work when the outdoor air temperature drops to a certain point. The default choice is {OnDemand}.
Currently, the {Timed} option is to be used with an electric resistive defrost heater only (see Field: Resistive Defrost Heater Capacity). the {OnDemand} option is used with fuel resources and the defrost EIR curve is used for the fuel energy adjustment.
This field applies to the HeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Heating object only. It does not apply to the HeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Cooling object.

For the heating mode:
    
    
    Specify a branch for the Heat pump in hot water loop .
    
    Include the branch name in the splitter and mixer branches.

# CentralHeatPumpSystem

`CentralHeatPumpSystem`
```
This is a central geothermal application that contains one or more chiller-heaters centrally located in the building; the available chilled and/or hot water is then piped to the individual zones. Chiller-heaters used for this particular system can be of two types: 1) standard vapor-compression, non-reversible cycle chillers designed for heat recovery or 2) reversible-cycle, water-to-water heat pump chillers. Unlike a distributed ground source heat pump configuration where individual heat pumps are located in each zone, a centralized geothermal configuration has one or more chiller-heaters. Its function is to encapsulate the extra controls needed to turn individual chiller-heater modules on/off and whether they are to operate in cooling-only, heating-only or simultaneous cooling-heating mode and whether to connect the source water to the evaporator or condenser side. A variety of control schemes can be designed by setting schedules for both zone control types and individual chiller-heaters schedules.
The fluid used in this central system is usually water, and there is no sharing of condenser or evaporator water between multiple machines. However, the control logic is such that the source water can be delivered to individual chiller-heaters depending on their operating mode, e.g., modules in simultaneous cooling-heating mode receive no source water, modules in heating-only mode can have source water directed to their evaporator, or modules in cooling-only mode can have source water directed to their condenser; the decision on which module(s) receives the source water dictated by the `smart' controls. The following figures illustrate node interconnections between this central geothermal application and plant and condenser loops in various situations.
The order of the multiple chiller-heaters' operation is assumed to be sequential. In other words, the very first chiller-heater will be called at first to see if it meets all loads that the central heat pump system should meet. If the chiller-heater meets all loads, the rest chiller-heaters are assumed to be turned off. If not, the following chiller-heater will be called to meet the remaining loads until all loads are met in the order as defined in the set of individual chiller-heater objects below. The order of individual chiller-heater modules needs to be carefully arranged in case users are intended to see the performance of various combinations of different sizes of chiller-heaters in a central heat pump system.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
In the above example, the cooling load needs 3 chiller-heaters and the heating load needs 1 chiller heater. Chiller 1 is in heat recovery mode and isolated from the ground source loop while chillers 2 and 3 are in cooling-only mode, their condensers rejecting heat to the ground source loop.
    
    
    
In the above example, the heating load needs 3 chiller-heaters and the cooling load needs two chiller-heaters. Chillers 1 and 2 are in heat recovery mode and isolated from the ground source loop while chiller 3 is in heating-only mode, its evaporator extracting heat from the ground source loop.
Users are required to define three different nodes such as chilled water, hot water, and source water nodes. Only this central heat pump system will be metered, and individual chiller-heaters' energy will be available for reporting only, but not metered.

# ChillerHeaterPerformanceElectricEIR

`ChillerHeaterPerformance:Electric:EIR`
```
The performance of the chiller-heater will be defined by two sets of curves meant to describe unloading for: 1) cooling-only mode, and 2) heating-only mode or simultaneous cooling-heating mode. Reference conditions must be defined for both because each has its own set of three unloading curves based on their associated reference conditions. The cooling-mode curves are typically (but not always) based on condenser entering water temperature while the heating-only mode curves are typically based on condenser leaving water temperature. This chiller-heater object allows the user to specify whether to use condenser leaving or condenser entering as a dependent variable to differentiate, if necessary, the condenser temperature basis used to generate the cooling- and heating-only mode curves.

```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the pump outlet node.
```
	
##  Field: Design Maximum Flow Rate 
DesignMaximumFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the pump's design maximum volume flow rate in cubic meters per second. This field can be autosized.
```
	
##  Field: Design Pump Head 
DesignPumpHead
```
This numeric field contains the pump's design head pressure in Pascals. The default is 179352 Pa, or 60 ftH20, and is for a fairly large building.
```
	
##  Field: Design Power Consumption 
DesignPowerConsumption
```
This numeric field contains the pump's design power consumption in Watts. If the user is performing a pressure simulation on the loop in which this pump is found, this value would only be used to estimate pump efficiency. During reported calculations, the pump would use the loop pressure drop and current flow conditions along with efficiency to calculate pump power dynamically. This field can be autosized. When set to autosize the type of scaling factor is chosen in the input field Design Power Sizing Method.
```

```
	
##  Field: Coefficient 1 of the Part Load Performance Curve 
Coefficient1OfThePartLoadPerformanceCurve
```
This numeric field contains the first coefficient in the part load ratio curve. The fraction of full load power is determined by the cubic equation:
FractionFullLoadPower = {C_1} + {C_2}PLR + {C_3}PL{R^2} + {C_4}PL{R^3}
where C_{1},C_{2},C_{3},and C_{4} are Coefficients 1 4 (below) and PLR is the Part Load Ratio.
```

DesignMinimumFlowRate
```
This field contains the minimum volume flow rate while operating in variable flow capacity rate in cubic meters per second. This field is autosizable. When set to autosize the value in the input field Design Minimum Flow Rate Sizing Factor is used to scale the minimum flow rate as a fraction of the Design Maximum Flow Rate.  Note that this Design Minimum Flow Rate should be less than the Design Maximum Flow Rate for a variable speed pump.  If the user enters a Design Minimum Flow Rate that is more than 99% of the Design Maximum Flow Rate, a warning message is produced and the Design Minimum Flow Rate is reset to 99% of the Design Maximum Flow Rate.
```
	
##  Field: Pump Control Type 
PumpControlType
```
This is a choice field of Continuous or Intermittent. A variable speed pump is defined with maximum and minimum flow rates that are the physical limits of the device. If there is no load on the loop and the pump is operating intermittently, then the pump can shutdown. For any other condition such as the loop having a load and the pump is operating intermittently or the pump is continuously operating (regardless of the loading condition), the pump will operate and select a flow somewhere between the minimum and maximum limits. In these cases where the pump is running, it will try to meet the flow request made by demand side components. Applicable availability managers (ref. {AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList}) may override this control by forcing the pump to be on or off.
```
	
##  Field: Pump Flow Rate Schedule Name 
PumpFlowRateScheduleName
```
The schedule values modify the value for Rated Flow Rate of the pump on a time basis. This essentially sets the maximum value available for the pump at a given time, {not the actual flow rate at that time}. The default is that the pump is ON and runs according to its other operational requirements specified above. This schedule is for special, not typical pump operations. For additional control over pump flow, EMS actuators can be employed.
```
	
##  Field: Pump Curve Name

```
	
##  Field: VFD Control Type 
VFDControlType
```
This string defines which type of VFD control type to perform. PressureSetPointControl is a realistic approach which requires inputs of pressure range schedules to control the pump rpm to maintain a certain pressure drop (head). ManualControl is an idealized control strategy in which the pump RPM is maintained at a scheduled value throughout the simulation, abiding by other flow restrictions in the loop.
```
	
##  Field: Pump RPM Schedule Name 
PumpRPMScheduleName
```
For VFD Control Type = ManualControl, this defines the pump RPM schedule to use during the simulation. For VFD Control Type = PressureSetPointControl, this field is not interpreted. The value of the schedule is RPM.

```
	
##  Field: Maximum RPM Schedule 
MaximumRPMSchedule
```
For VFD Control Type = PressureSetPointControl, this field defines the maximum allowable RPM, or the upper bound of pump speed to use when determining the required pump speed. For VFD Control Type = ManualControl, this field is not interpreted. The value of the schedule is RPM.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Name 
ZoneName
```
This field is optional. It can be used to input the name of the Zone in which the pump is located in the model. If the pump is outdoors, or skin losses are not to be modeled, then leave this field blank. If a valid Zone name is entered, then the portion of electrical power consumed by the pump that is not added to the working fluid is added to the surrounding Zone.
```
	
##  Field: Skin Loss Radiative Fraction 
SkinLossRadiativeFraction
```
This field is optional. If a Zone is named in the previous field and pump losses are to be added to a surrounding thermal zone, then this input determines the split between thermal radiation and thermal convection for the heat losses from the pump. If it is left blank then all the losses will be convective.
```
	
##  Field: Design Power Sizing Method 
DesignPowerSizingMethod
```
This field is optional. There are two choices PowerPerFlow and PowerPerFlowPerPressure. If PowerPerFlow is used the pump's Design Power Consumption will be calculated using the sizing factor from the input field Design Electric Power per Unit Flow Rate -- with Design Power Consumption = Design Maximum Flow Rate * scaling factor. If PowerPerFlowPerPressure is used the pump's Design Power Consumption will use the sizing factor from the input field Design Shaft Power per Unit Flow Rate Per Unit Head -- with Design Power Consumption = Design Maximum Flow Rate * Design Pump Head * scaling factor / Motor Efficiency. If omitted the default method of PowerPerFlowPerPressure will be used.
```
	
##  Field: Design Electric Power per Unit Flow Rate

```
This field is optional. This input is used when the input field Design Power Consumption is set to autosize and the Design Power Sizing Method is set to PowerPerFlow. It allows setting the efficiency the pumping system's power consumption using only the design flow rate. If omitted the default value of 348701.1 W/(m^{3}/s) ( 22 W/gpm) will be used.
```

```
	
##  Field: Pump Control Type 
PumpControlType
```
This is a choice field of Continuous or Intermittent. The operation of a constant speed pump is fairly straightforward. If the user designates a constant speed pump that is operating continuously, the pump will run regardless of whether or not there is a load. This may have the net effect of adding heat to the loop if no equipment is turned on. If the pump is constant speed and operates intermittently, the pump will run at its capacity if a load is sensed and will shut off if there is no load on the loop. Applicable availability managers (ref. {AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList}) may override this control by forcing the pump to be on or off.
```
	
##  Field: Pump Flow Rate Schedule Name 
PumpFlowRateScheduleName
```
The schedule values modify the value for Rated Flow Rate of the pump on a time basis. This essentially sets the maximum value available for the pump at a given time, {not the actual flow rate at that time}. The default is that the pump is ON and runs according to its other operational requirements specified above. This schedule is for special, not typical pump operations. For additional control over pump flow, EMS actuators can be employed.
```
	
##  Field:Pump Curve Name 
PumpCurveName
```
This field is only used if the user is performing a pressure-based simulation in the plant loop of the LoopFlowCorrection type (see {PlantLoop} section for how to enable this).
This field references a separate pressure head curve that the user has input separately in the input file. The pressure curve represents a non-dimensional regression of pressure-flow rate data. The equation should be of the following form:
\psi  = {C_4} \times {\varphi ^4} + {C_3} \times {\varphi ^3} + {C_2} \times {\varphi ^2} + {C_1} \times \varphi  + {C_0}.
In this equation, the two dimensionless parameters, X and X are defined in terms of physical pump and flow parameters as:
\psi  = \frac{{Δ P}}{{ρ {N^2}{D^2}}}
\varphi  = \frac{{\dot m}}{{ρ N{D^3}}}
Where Delta P is the pressure drop, mdot is the fluid mass flow rate, rho is a representative fluid density, N is the rotational speed of the pump, and D is the pump impeller diameter.
Since the user may not need a full fourth order expansion of this, the user may use linear (first order), quadratic (second order), cubic (third order), or full quartic (fourth order). These are available in the objects {Curve:Linear}, {Curve:Quadratic}, {Curve:Cubic}, {Curve:Quartic}.
Once this curve is input properly (along with the following two fields), the pump will respond to the plant loop pressure drop when resolving the flow rate. Note that this simulation method will likely result in a plant loop that does not exactly hit the setpoint as the current simulation method does. This is due to the loop flow rate now being pressure-based and not decision-based .
```
	
##  Field:Impeller Diameter 
ImpellerDiameter
```
This field is only used if the user is performing a pressure-based simulation in the plant loop of the LoopFlowCorrection type (see {PlantLoop} section for how to enable this).
To re-dimensionalize the dimensionless pump curve, the impeller diameter must be known. This value is entered in meters.
```
	
##  Field:Rotational Speed 
RotationalSpeed
```
This field is only used if the user is performing a pressure-based simulation in the plant loop of the LoopFlowCorrection type (see {PlantLoop} section for how to enable this).
To re-dimensionalize the dimensionless pump curve, the rotational speed must be known. This value is entered in RPM (revolutions per minute).
```
	
##  Field: Zone Name 
ZoneName
```
This field is optional. It can be used to input the name of the Zone in which the pump is located in the model. If the pump is outdoors, or skin losses are not to be modeled, then leave this field blank. If a valid Zone name is entered, then the portion of electrical power consumed by the pump that is not added to the working fluid is added to the surrounding Zone.
```
	
##  Field: Skin Loss Radiative Fraction 
SkinLossRadiativeFraction
```
This field is optional. If a Zone is named in the previous field and pump losses are to be added to a surrounding thermal zone, then this input determines the split between thermal radiation and thermal convection for the heat losses from the pump. If it is left blank then all the losses will be convective.
```
	
##  Field: Design Power Sizing Method 
DesignPowerSizingMethod
```
This field is optional. There are two choices PowerPerFlow and PowerPerFlowPerPressure. If omitted the default method of PowerPerFlowPerPressure will be used.
If PowerPerFlow is used the pump's Design Power Consumption will be calculated using the sizing factor from the input field Design Electrical Power per Unit Flow Rate -- with Design Power Consumption = Design Maximum Flow Rate * scaling factor.
If PowerPerFlowPerPressure is used the pump's Design Power Consumption will use the sizing factor from the input field Design Shaft Power per Unit Flow Rate Per Unit Head -- with Design Power Consumption = Design Maximum Flow Rate * Design Pump Head * scaling factor / Motor Efficiency.
```
	
##  Field: Design Electrical Power per Unit Flow Rate 
DesignElectricalPowerPerUnitFlowRate
```
This field is optional. This input is used when the input field Design Power Consumption is set to autosize and the Design Power Sizing Method is set to PowerPerFlow. It allows setting the efficiency the pumping system's power consumption using only the design flow rate. If omitted the default value of 348701.1 W/(m^{3}/s) (22 W/gpm) will be used.

DesignShaftPowerPerUnitFlowRatePerUnitHead
```
This field is optional. This input is used when the input field Design Power Consumption is set to autosize and the Design Power Sizing Method is set to PowerPerFlowPerPressure. It allows controlling the efficiency of the impeller and drive assembly when calculating the pump power consumption for the design flow rate, motor efficiency, and pump head. If omitted the default value of 1.282051 W/((m^{3}/s)-Pa) will be used.
```
	
##  Field: End-Use Subcategory 
EndUseSubcategory
```
Allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Main Pumps'', etc. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref: Output:Meter objects). Subcategories are also reported in the ABUPS table. If this field is omitted or blank, the pump will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.

It typically ranges from 65.56°C to 115.36°C in the I = B = R rating document while the lowest allowable temperature is 32.22°C. The default value is 87.78°C. If the user does not enter this field, the default value is assumed.
```
	
##  Field: Rated Water Mass Flow Rate 
RatedWaterMassFlowRate
```
This field is the rated standard water flow rate in kg/s which is published as part of the manufacturer's literature. It is used by the manufacturers when determining the rated capacity (see next field). The default value is 0.063kg/s. If it is blank or zero, the default values is assumed.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Design Capacity {W} 
HeatingDesignCapacityW
```
This field is the radiant-convective water baseboard rated capacity in watts at a rated water mass flow rate (see input field Rated Mass Flow Rate). Almost all publications from manufacturers indicate it as W/m (Btuh per linear foot). The user thus must multiply it by the active length of the unit. The active length is available in the literature. Manufacturers are required to publish the difference between active and total length of the unit (I = B = R rating for boilers baseboard radiation, 2009).If it is blank or zero, autosizing is assumed. Design day sizing run must be specified for autosizing.

```
	
##  Field: Surface <x> Name 
SurfaceXName
```
This field is the name of the first surface to which radiant heat transfer from the baseboard heater is distributed. Used in conjunction with the next field, it helps to define the distribution of the radiant energy on the surfaces within the zone. Note that up to 20 pairs of surface names and corresponding fractions may be entered for a single radiant heater system.
```
	
##  Field: Fraction of Radiant Energy to Surface <x> 
FractionOfRadiantEnergyToSurfaceX
```
This field is paired with the preceding surface name (previous field) to define the fraction of radiant heat transfer leaving the baseboard heater that is incident on a particular surface. Users should take into account the directionality of baseboard heaters and their location when defining the value for this input field.
{{Note on Fraction of Radiant Energy Incident on {People} and to Surfaces}}
The radiant energy from the baseboard heater is defined by the total energy input to the baseboard heater from the water loop times the fraction radiant field shown above. This radiant energy is distributed to surfaces and people using the surface and fraction pairs and the fraction to people input by the user. These fractions to people and surfaces must add up to 1.0. In other words, in an input file, the following relation should be maintained by the user input:
FractionIndicentOnPeople + \sum {FractionToSurfaces = 1}

```
This field specifies the fraction of the radiant portion of heat transfer to the zone from the baseboard heater that is incident directly on people within the space. This has an impact on the predicted thermal comfort of the zone occupants. Note that although this energy is ``radiant'' it is actually modeled in the zone heat balance as a convective energy (like an internal gain). The basic assumption here is that radiant energy falling on people will most likely be rereleased to the zone air by convection. This is a simplification of reality, but it maintains the overall energy balance.

# ZoneHVACCoolingPanelRadiantConvectiveWater

`ZoneHVAC:CoolingPanel:RadiantConvective:Water`
```
The radiant/convective cooling panel is a type of zone equipment.  Chilled water is supplied by the plant and circulated through the panel.  Through radiation and convective heat transfer, the panel absorbs energy contained within the zone to provide cooling.  Control of the panel is achieved using the methodology used for low temperature radiant systems???a piecewise linear control profile that varies the flow rate to the panel based on a control parameter defined by the user.  This is different than being controlled to meet any remaining load like the air-based systems.  However, due to the radiant nature of these devices, it is not possible to control precisely on a zone air-based load since this will result in overcooling at the next time step.  Despite this, in addition to the piecewise linear controls that have been used with low temperature radiant systems in the past, two new controls are available for this simple model: one that varies the convective output of the system to meet the remaining zone load and one that varies the total convective output of the system to meet the remaining zone load.  In these two zone load control types, the user must enter the typical zone thermostat object to replace the setpoint and throttling range input in this object.  In this component, control is accomplished by throttling the chilled water flow to the device.  Capacity rating information is required as input and is used to calculate a UA value of the unit. The unit is connected to a chilled water loop (demand side) with an inlet and outlet node. The input data dictionary definition of the unit is as follows.
```

```
	
##  Field: Outlet Node Name

```
	
##  Field: Rated Inlet Water Temperature 
RatedInletWaterTemperature
```
This field is the inlet temperature to the panel under conditions used to rate the capacity of the panel.  This value along with the other rating condition parameters is used to calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient (U-Value) that will be used to characterize the heat transfer between the water being circulated through the panel and the air in the zone.  The default value is 5°C (41°F).
```
	
##  Field: Rated Space Temperature 
RatedSpaceTemperature
```
This field is the combined space temperature (air and surface) that the panel is exposed to during the rating process to obtain a rated capacity.  This value along with the other rated conditions is used to calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient (U-Value) that will be used to characterize the heat transfer between the water being circulated through the panel and the air in the zone.  The default value is 24°C (75.2°F).
```
	
##  Field: Rated Water Mass Flow Rate 
RatedWaterMassFlowRate
```
This field is the rated standard water flow rate in kg/s that was used to obtain the design cooling capacity under rated temperature conditions.  This value along with the rated space and water inlet temperatures as well as the cooling capacity (whether autosized or entered by the user) is used to calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient (U-Value) that will be used to characterize the heat transfer between the water being circulated through the panel and the air in the space.  Users should note that if this value is too low in comparison to the cooling design capacity that the program will produce an error message and the user must adjust one of these two parameters or the rated temperature values.  The default value is 0.063kg/s (1 gpm).  If it is blank or zero, the default value is assumed.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Design Capacity Method 
CoolingDesignCapacityMethod
```
This field defines the method used to determine the cooling design capacity for scalable sizing. The inputs that are allowed for this field include: {CoolingDesignCapacity}, {CapacityPerFloorArea}, or {FractionOfAutosizedCoolingCapacity}. If this input field is left blank, then the {CoolingDesignCapacity} method is assumed to be valid for this unit. {CoolingDesignCapacity} means the user specifies the magnitude of maximum or nominal cooling capacity or the program calculates the maximum or nominal design cooling capacity if autosize is specified. {CapacityPerFloorArea} means the program calculates the design cooling capacity from the user specified cooling capacity per floor area and the floor area of the zone served by the cooling panel unit. {FractionOfAutosizedCoolingCapacity} means the program calculates the design cooling capacity from a user specified fraction and the auto-sized design cooling capacity.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Design Capacity 
CoolingDesignCapacity
```
This field contains the cooling panel unit nominal cooling capacity in Watts at the rated flow rate of water through the unit (see Rated Water Mass Flow Rate field above). This field can be autosized by EnergyPlus. When the Cooling Design Capacity Method is {CoolingDesignCapacity}~ and this input is blank, autosizing is assumed. A design day sizing run must be specified for this to be autosized.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Design Capacity Per Floor Area 
CoolingDesignCapacityPerFloorArea
```
This field is used to enter the cooling capacity per unit floor area in W/m2 for the cooling panel unit. This field is a required field when the Cooling Design Capacity Method is {CapacityPerFloorArea}. The program calculates the cooling capacity from floor area of the zone served by the cooling panel unit and the cooling capacity per unit floor area value specified by the user. This field may be left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Fraction of Autosized Cooling Design Capacity 
FractionOfAutosizedCoolingDesignCapacity
```
This field is used to enter the cooling capacity as a fraction of the autosized cooling capacity for the cooling panel. This input field is required when the Cooling Design Capacity Method is {FractionOfAutosizedCoolingCapacity}. The program calculates the cooling capacity from the design autosized cooling capacity and the user specified fraction. A design day sizing run must be specified. This field may be left blank, and the default value is 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Chilled Water Flow Rate 
MaximumChilledWaterFlowRate
```
This field specifies the maximum chilled water volumetric flow rate in m3/sec.  This field can also be autosized.
```
	
##  Field: Control Type 
ControlType
```
This field specifies two different types of control categories: temperature or zone load.  For one of the temperature based controls, this field along with the throttling range and setpoint schedules determines how the user wishes to control the radiant cooling panel.  The temperature denoted in the setpoint schedule can refer to one of five different temperatures: the zone mean air temperature, the zone mean radiant temperature, the zone operative temperature, the outdoor dry-bulb temperature, or the outdoor wet-bulb temperature.  The current field controls the choice of temperature.  For controls that are based more on zone load, the user can make one of two choices based on whether the zone load is met by only the convective output of the unit or the total output of the unit.  These zone load controls will not perform as precisely as air-based systems.  The convective zone load control will come close to meeting the current setpoint temperature (defined by the typical zone thermostat input by the user) since the convective output of the unit will be set to match the remaining zone load.  However, in the long run, this will likely overcool the space since radiant energy is being absorbed by surfaces and this will impact the zone conditions at later time steps.  The total zone load control will likely undercool the space in the short term since the total output (radiant and convective) of the unit will be set to meet the remaining zone load.  However, this will not fully impact the zone air temperature immediately since some of the energy is being absorbed from surfaces rather than the zone air.  The user must select from the following options:
  MeanAirTemperature
  MeanRadiantTemperature
  OperativeTemperature
  OutdoorDryBulbTemperature
  OutdoorWetBulbTemperature
  ZoneConvectiveLoad
  ZoneTotalLoad
Operative temperature for radiant system controls is the average of Mean Air Temperature and Mean Radiant Temperature. If the user does not select a control type, MeanAirTemperature control is assumed by EnergyPlus. See the throttling range and control temperature schedule fields below for more information.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Control Throttling Range 
CoolingControlThrottlingRange
```
This field specifies the range of temperature in degrees Celsius over which the radiant cooling panel throttles from zero flow rate up to the maximum defined by the maximum chilled water flow rate field described above. The throttling range parameter is used in conjunction with the control temperature to define the response of the system to various zone conditions. The cooling control temperature schedule specifies the ???setpoint??? temperature where the flow rate to the system is at half of the maximum flow rate. For example, if the cooling control temperature setpoint is currently 25 C and the cooling throttling range is 2 C, the water flow rate to the radiant system will be zero when the controlling temperature (MAT, MRT, Operative Temperature, ODB, or OWB; see control type field above) is at or below 24 C and the maximum flow rate when the controlling temperature is at or above 26 C. This represents a throttling range of 2 C around the setpoint of 25 C. In between 24 C and 26 C, the flow rate to the radiant system is varied linearly.  Note that this field is ignored when the control type is either ZoneLoadConvective or ZoneLoadTotal.  For the two zone load controls, the user must use a typical zone thermostat and the system output will be dependent on the remaining zone load.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Control Temperature Schedule Name 
CoolingControlTemperatureScheduleName
```
This field specifies the cooling setpoint or control temperature for the radiant cooling panel in degrees Celsius. Used in conjunction with the previous field (cooling control throttling range), it will define whether or not the system is running and the current flow rate. Water flow rate to the system is varied linearly around the setpoint temperature based on the throttling range and the maximum cooling flow rate parameters (see above). It should be noted that this control schedule will allow different setpoint temperatures throughout the year for cooling. The control of the radiant cooling panel is based solely on the cooling control throttling range listed above, the cooling control temperature schedule, and the control temperature type listed above. The radiant cooling panel will not use any zone thermostat that might be used by other systems serving the zone in which this radiant cooling panel resides.  Note that this field is ignored when the control type is either ZoneLoadConvective or ZoneLoadTotal.  For the two zone load controls, the user must use a typical zone thermostat and the system output will be dependent on the remaining zone load.
```
	
##  Field: Condensation Control Type 
CondensationControlType
```
Since radiant cooling panels provide a cold surface in what could be a humid zone, there is the possibility that condensation will occur on the surface of the panel. This is due to the fact that the surface temperature may drop below the dew-point temperature of the space. When this occurs, condensation on the surface will occur. Since there is no direct calculation of the surface temperature of the radiant cooling panel, the condensation check will be made at the inlet water temperature to the panel. Since the user can utilize the next parameter to adjust the differential between the dewpoint temperature and the inlet water temperature, this will allow some flexibility in controlling when the panel will shutdown to avoid condensation. There are three options for handling potential condensation: Off, SimpleOff, and VariableOff. This parameter is optional and will default to SimpleOff.
  Off - EnergyPlus will not do anything other than produce a warning message when condensation is predicted to occur. The program will simply continue on; no moisture will be removed from the zone air and there will be no adjustment of the surface temperature as a result of the condensation.
  SimpleOff - the program will predict cases where condensation will occur and shut-off the radiant system to avoid this situation. With this option, the user also has the option to adjust when the system will shut down. This is specified with the next parameter (field: Condensation Differential Parameter).
  VariableOff - the program will attempt to reduce the inlet temperature to the panel by locally recirculating some of the water leaving the panel and mixing it with water from the overall demand side flow.  This also means that some of the demand side water will bypass the panel. In reality, this would require a pump to achieve such mixing and recirculation, but due to the simple nature of this model, no pump definition will be required. Like the SimpleOff option, the VariableOff option uses the condensation dewpoint offset parameter to adjust when the system will try to adjust for the possibility of condensation.
```
	
##  Field: Condensation Control Dewpoint Offset 
CondensationControlDewpointOffset
```
This optional parameter is only valid with the SimpleOff and VariableOff condensation handling algorithm (see previous input parameter). It establishes the difference between the calculated dew-point temperature of the space and the allowed inlet water temperature to the radiant cooling panel before the system shuts down in degrees Celsius. This parameter can be any positive, negative, or zero value. When this parameter is zero, the radiant system will shut down or recirculate water (depending on whether SimpleOff or VariableOff is used) when the inlet temperature drops to the dew-point temperature or below. When this parameter is positive, the radiant system will shut down or recirculate water when the inlet water temperature is the number of degrees Celsius above the dew-point temperature. This allows some extra safety to avoid condensation. When this parameter is negative, the radiant system will shut down or recirculate water when the inlet water temperature is the number of degrees Celsius below the dew-point temperature. This strategy allows the user to simulate a situation where small amounts of condensation are tolerable or the resistance of the panel from the water loop to the panel surface is being taken into account as condensation would likely happen at the panel surface. The default value for this parameter is 1°C.
```
	
##  Field: Fraction Radiant 
FractionRadiant
```
This field allows the user an opportunity to characterize the heat transfer at the surface of the panel as either purely radiative, purely convective, or some combination of radiant and convective.  As a result, through this parameter, EnergyPlus gives the user an opportunity to characterize the zone temperature as a function of the zone mean radiant temperature and the mean air temperature.  The performance of the unit is proportional to the difference between the water inlet temperature and the zone temperature where the zone temperature is found using a weighted average of zone mean radiant temperature and mean air temperature.  The weighting factor is this parameter, and it is multiplied by the zone mean radiant temperature.  The remainder of the zone temperature calculation is made up of the zone mean air temperature.  During modeling, it is likewise used to calculate how much of the energy being absorbed by the unit is radiant energy.  This parameter can be difficult to quantify as the fraction radiant can vary with zone conditions.  However, by definition, a radiant system like this radiant cooling panel exchanges at least half of its energy to the zone via radiation.  One study has shown that a fraction radiant between 0.6 and 0.7 is a reasonable estimation.  For more information, see the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference in section Radiant System Models, subsection Simple Radiant Cooling Panel.

##  Field: Fraction of Radiant Energy Incident on People 
FractionOfRadiantEnergyIncidentOnPeople
```
This field allows the user to direct some of the radiant energy to be absorbed from people rather than surfaces within the space.  This has a direct impact on thermal comfort and depends on the location of the people with respect to the radiant cooling panel.  All energy absorbed by the panel would have a cooling effect on people and is subtracted from the total radiant energy absorbed by the panel defined by the previous term.
```
	
##  Field Set: Surface Name, Fraction of Radiant Energy to Surface 
SetSurfaceNameFractionOfRadiantEnergyToSurface
```
These two fields are repeated for up to 100 surface/fraction pairs. At least one surface/fraction pair must appear in an input file. In other words, at least one surface must be identified as a recipient of radiant energy from the baseboard heater.
The radiant energy from the cooling panel is defined by the total energy input to the cooling panel from the chilled water loop times the fraction radiant field shown above. This radiant energy is received from surfaces and people using the surface and fraction pairs and the fraction to people input by the user. These fractions from people and surfaces must add up to 1.0. In other words, in an input file, the following relation should be maintained by the user input:
FractionIndicentOnPeople + \sum {FractionToSurfaces} = 1
```
	
##  Field Set: Surface <x> Name 
SetSurfaceXName
```
The radiant energy absorbed by the radiant cooling panel can be specified to be received from particular surfaces within the space.  The next series of pairs of inputs (surface name and fraction of radiant energy) specify where this radiant energy is coming from.  In essence, the fraction radiant terms for each surface are similar to a view factor.  These pairs can be repeated for up to 100 surfaces giving the user plenty of flexibility to have the radiant cooling panel interact with many potential surfaces.  This first parameter in the pair is the name of the surface defined by user input elsewhere in the input file.  Note that the surface must reside in the same zone as all of the other surfaces in the following list (that is, all surfaces listed must be in the same zone).
```
	
##  Field Set: Fraction of Radiant Energy to Surface <x> 
SetFractionOfRadiantEnergyToSurfaceX
```
In combination with the previous field, this defines what fraction of the radiant energy being absorbed by the radiant cooling panel comes from the surface named by the previous field.  These pairs of surface names and fractions of radiant energy from the surface can be repeated up to 100 times in the input for a particular radiant cooling panel.  Note that the sum of all of the surface radiant energy fractions plus the radiant fraction from people must add up to unity just like in the radiant-convective baseboard models.  Note that there is a small possibility that a particular surface listed in these pairs is actually lower than the temperature of the panel.  This probably will not happen unless there is another cooling surface within the zone.  In reality, absorbing net radiant energy from a colder surface would violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  However, in keeping with the simple nature of this model, EnergyPlus will monitor the inlet water temperature to the panel and produce a warning message if this temperature is lower than any of the surface temperature of the surfaces with which this system is interacting.

`ZoneHVAC:Baseboard:Convective:Water`
```
The hot water baseboard heater is a component of zone equipment. The component is controlled to meet any remaining zone load not met by other equipment in the zone that have higher heating priority. The control is accomplished by throttling the hot water flow. Input resembles that for the simple heating coil: there is an availability schedule, an overall UA, and a maximum hot water mass flow rate. The unit is connected to a hot water loop (demand side) with an inlet and outlet node. Finally, there is the convergence tolerance, which is the tolerance on how closely the baseboard outlet will meet the zone load. Of course, this tolerance is relative to the zone load.

# ZoneHVACLowTemperatureRadiantVariableFlow

`ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:VariableFlow`
```
This low temperature radiant system (hydronic) is a component of zone equipment that is intended to model any ``radiant system'' where water is used to supply/remove energy to/from a building surface (wall, ceiling, or floor). The component is controlled to meet any remaining zone load not met by other equipment in the zone that have higher priority. The control is accomplished by throttling the hot or chilled water flow to the unit. Note that this system will only control based on the radiant system controls defined by this input syntax and not via a zone thermostat such as is used for forced air systems. Note also that because this unit does not require a thermostat that in cases where no other systems are serving the zone in which this system resides that it will use the heating equipment priority to determine which system will run first.~ If the radiant system is serving a zone with forced air equipment, the radiant system will follow the priority order established by the zone thermostat but will still base its response on the controls defined by the user for the radiant system.
This model covers a wide range of low temperature radiant systems: heating and/or cooling, panel or embedded pipes, etc. It is not intended to simulate high temperature electric or gas radiant heaters. Those devices will be handled by a separate model and different input syntax. Low temperature radiant systems that use electric resistance heating should also be defined using separate input syntax (ref: {ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:Electric}).  The key characteristic of this variable flow low temperature radiant system is that the actual fluid flow rate being supplied to the radiant system changes as conditions within the zone change.  While the fluid temperature is determined by the plant loops defined by other user input, this type of radiant system will control fluid flow in an attempt to meet the remaining zone heating or cooling load based on the controls outlined below.   Low temperature radiant systems that vary the inlet temperature while keeping the fluid flow rate through the radiant system constant should also be defined using separate input syntax (ref: {ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:ConstantFlow}).

##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This field is the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the hydronic low temperature radiant system can run during a given time period.

```
This field is the name of the zone (Ref: Zone) in which the hydronic low temperature radiant system is principally located and intended to affect.

If this field is a surface list, then the source or sink is attached to all of the surfaces in the list with the radiant system surface group defining the breakdown of how flow rate is split between the various surfaces. Note also that surfaces in a list do not need to be in the same zone or in the zone being served by this system (see previous field). Base surfaces (e.g., {BuildingSurface:Detailed}), door surfaces and internal mass are valid. Window surfaces are not valid surface types for embedded radiant systems.
```
	
##  Field: Hydronic Tubing Length

```
This field is the total length of pipe embedded in the surface named above in the surface name field.

Longer tubing lengths result in more heat will be transferred to/from the radiant surface to the circulating fluid. Note that if the user elects to autosize this field that a standard zone thermostat such as would be used for a forced air system must be defined as autosizing calculations are based on the zone thermostat value and not on the radiant system control values. In addition, when the user opts to autosize this calculation, the tube spacing from the construction of each surface associated with this system is used along with each individual surface area to make an approximation of the tubing length.

This field is the maximum flow rate of cold water through the radiant system in m^{3}/sec.~The controls for the radiant system will vary the flow rate of cold water through the surface using zero flow and the maximum flow rate specified in this field as the lower and upper bounds, respectively. Note that this field is optional and not required for a heating only system.

##  Field: Fluid to Radiant Surface Heat Transfer Model 
FluidToRadiantSurfaceHeatTransferModel
```
This field is provides the opportunity to control how the heat transfer between the fluid circulating through this radiant system and the radiant system itself.  There are two options for this parameter: ConvectionOnly or ISOStandard.  The default value is ConvectionOnly.  More information on each of these options is provided below.
	
	ConvectionOnly - This is the default mode and the method that was implemented when the radiant model was first introduced into EnergyPlus.  In this modeling option, it is assumed that the impact of the tube material on heat exchange between the fluid and the radiant system and that only the convection between the fluid and the radiant system is the only critical heat transfer mechanism to take into account.  The reasoning behind this included the fact that there are other simplifications in the method for calculating heat transfer and that this simplification would not result in any significant difference in the simulated heat transfer performance of the system.  Convection between the fluid and the pipe wall of the system is related to physical parameters of the system (pipe/tube inner diameter and length) as well as the flow characteristics.
	
	ISOStandard - This method is based on the ISO Standard 11855, Part 2 (2012) document entitled ``Building environment design ??? Design, dimensioning, installation and control of embedded radiant heating and cooling systems ??? Part 2: Determination of the design heating and cooling capacity'', Reference Number ISO 11855-2:2012(E).  This standard recommends equations (see Appendix B of this document) to include the effects of convective heat transfer between the fluid and the inside of the piping and conduction through the pipe wall.  This model requires both the inner and outer diameter of the pipe/tube, the length of the pipe/tube, and the thermal conductivity of the pipe/tube material.  Note that as part of the implementation of this model in EnergyPlus, flow within the piping/tubing is always assumed to be turbulent.

This field is the inside diameter of the tubes through which the fluid is circulated for the system being defined by this statement. The inner diameter should be recorded in meters and is used to determine the convective heat transfer from the water to the inside surface of the hydronic tubing.  The default for this parameter is 0.013 which is approximately equivalent to the inner diameter of a typical 1/2 PEX pipe size.
```
	
##  Field: Hydronic Tubing Outside Diameter 
HydronicTubingOutsideDiameter
```
This field is the outside diameter of the tubes through which the fluid is circulated for the system being defined by this statement. The outer diameter should be recorded in meters and is used to determine the conduction through the hydronic tubing and the contact resistance between the tube/pipe and the radiant system itself in the ISOStandard option for the Fluid to Radiant Surface Heat Transfer Model (see above).  The default for this parameter is 0.016 which is approximately equivalent to the outer diameter a typical 1/2 PEX pipe size.
```
	
##  Field: Hydronic Tubing Conductivity 
HydronicTubingConductivity
```
This field is the thermal conductivity of the pipe/tube that is used in this radiant system in Watts per meter-Kelvin (W/m-K).  It is used to calculate the resistance to heat transfer through the pipe/tube wall in the ISOStandard option for the Fluid to Radiant Surface Heat Transfer Model (see above).  The default for this parameter is 0.35 which is the value given for PEX piping in ISO Standard 11855-2(2012).
```
	
##  Field: Temperature Control Type 
TemperatureControlType
```
This field specifies along with setpoint (control) and water schedules how the user wishes to control the constant flow radiant system. The temperature denoted in the setpoint schedule can refer to one of seven different temperatures: the zone mean air temperature, the zone mean radiant temperature, the zone operative temperature, the outdoor dry-bulb temperature, the outdoor wet-bulb temperature, the radiant surface inside face temperature, or the radiant surface interior temperature. The choice of temperature is controlled by the current field--temperature control type. The user must select from the following options:
	
	MeanAirTemperature - The mean air temperature of the zone being controlled by this radiant system.
	
	MeanRadiantTemperature - The mean radiant temperature of the zone being controlled by this radiant system.
	
	OperativeTemperature - The operative temperature of the zone being controlled by the radiant system. Operative temperature for radiant system controls is the average of Mean Air Temperature and Mean Radiant Temperature.
	
	OutdoorDryBulbTemperature - The outdoor dry-bulb temperature of the current outdoor environment.
	
	OutdoorWetBulbTemperature - The outdoor wet-bulb temperature of the current outdoor environment.
	
	SurfaceFaceTemperature - This option allows the user to control the radiant system using the inside face surface temperature of the radiant system (the inside surface temperature).
	 SurfaceInteriorTemperature - This option will allow the user to control
	the radiant system using a surface temperature that is calculated inside
	the radiant system.  This point will be defined by the
	{ConstructionProperty:InternalHeatSource}
	description for the system.  In that input, the user has the option to
	calculate a temperature at a particular point in the construction.  The
	radiant system will then use this information for controlling the slab
	not just producing temperatures for outputting at that point.  Users
	should consult the input for Field: Temperature Calculation Requested
	After Layer Number for more information.  Note that for the
	SurfaceFaceTemperature and SurfaceInteriorTemperature the surface being
	used for control is the surface listed in {Field: Surface Name or Radiant Surface Group Name}.  If the user enters a group of surfaces for that input, the
	{first} surface in the radiant group is the surface for control
	purposes.
If the user does not select a control type, {MeanAirTemperature} control is assumed by EnergyPlus. See the throttling range and control temperature schedule fields below for more information on how the setpoint temperature is established for this particular radiant system.
```
	
##  Field: Setpoint Control Type 
SetpointControlType
```
This field has two options (ZeroFlowPower and HalfFlowPower) and is used to determine the response of the low temperature radiant system at the setpoint temperature.  The Heating Control Temperature Schedule Name and Cooling Control Temperature Schedule Name (both listed below) define a schedule for a temperature setpoint.  The previous field (Temperature Control Type) defines which temperature is being controlled to that setpoint.  This field determines the response of the system when the temperature being controlled is at the temperature setpoint.  When ZeroFlowPower is chosen for this field, then the system will assume that it should shut off when the temperature controlled arrives at the setpoint.  So, if Mean Air Temperature control is used and it becomes equal to the setpoint temperature, then the system will turn off.  When HalfFlowPower is chosen for this field, then the system will assume that it should be at half of the maximum water flow when it achieves the setpoint condition.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Design Capacity Method 
HeatingDesignCapacityMethod
```
Enter the method used to determine the heating design capacity for scalable sizing. Input allowed is either {HeatingDesignCapacity}, {CapacityPerFloorArea}, and {FractionOfAutosizedHeatingCapacity}. If this input field is left blank or zero, then autosizing is assumed. {HeatingDesignCapacity} means user specifies the magnitude of maximum or nominal heating capacity or the program calculates the design heating capacity if autosize is specified. {CapacityPerFloorArea} means the program calculates the design heating capacity from user specified heating capacity per floor area and floor area of the zone served by the low temperature radiant variable flow unit. {FractionOfAutosizedHeatingCapacity} means the program calculates the design heating capacity from user specified fraction and the auto-sized design heating capacity. The default method is {HeatingDesignCapacity}.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Design Capacity Per Floor Area {W/m2} 
HeatingDesignCapacityPerFloorAreaWM2
```
Enter the heating capacity per unit floor area in m3/s-m2 of low temperature radiant variable flow unit. This field is required field when the Heating Design Capacity Method is {CapacityPerFloorArea}. The program calculates the heating capacity from floor area of the zone served by the low temperature radiant variable flow unit and the heating capacity per unit floor area value specified by the user. This field may be left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Fraction of Autosized Heating Design Capacity 
FractionOfAutosizedHeatingDesignCapacity
```
Enter the heating capacity as a fraction of the autosized heating capacity for low temperature radiant variable flow unit. This input field is required when the Heating Design Capacity Method is {FractionOfAutosizedHeatingCapacity}. The program calculates the heating capacity from the design autosized heat capacity and user specified fraction. Design day sizing run must be specified. This field may be left blank. Default value is 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Control Throttling Range 
HeatingControlThrottlingRange
```
This field specifies the range of temperature in degrees Celsuis over which the radiant system throttles from zero flow rate up to the maximum defined by the maximum hot water flow rate field described above. The throttling range parameter is used in conjunction with the control temperature and the setpoint type to define the response of the system to various conditions. The Heating Control Temperature Schedule specifies the ``setpoint'' temperature that is to be met.  This is used in conjunction with the Setpoint Type which defines whether the flow rate of the system is at zero flow or half flow when the parameter defined by the Temperature Control Type is equal to the setpoint temperature defined by the Heating Control Temperature Schedule.  See these other input parameters of this radiant system for more information on these different parameters.  Note that when the throttling range is set to zero that this approximates an on-off system that is either fully on or totally off.
For clarity, here is an example of how the flow rate to the system will be set.  In this example, it is assumed that heating control temperature setpoint is currently 15°C, the heating throttling range is 2°C, and that the setpoint type is HalfFlowPower.  The water flow rate to the radiant system will be zero when the controlling temperature (MAT, MRT, Operative Temperature, etc.; see control type field above) is at or above 16°C and the maximum flow rate when the controlling temperature is at or below 14°C. This represents a throttling range of 2°C around the setpoint of 15°C. In between 14°C and 16°C, the flow rate to the radiant system is varied linearly from full flow at a control temperature of 14°C to half flow at 15°C to zero flow at 16°C.  If the throttling range is changed to 0°C or on-off control, then the system will be off above 15°C and on below 15°C.  However, if the throttling range is kept at 2°C and the setpoint type is changed to ZeroFlowPower, then the system will vary the flow linearly between zero for when the control temperature is at 15°C to full flow at 13°C.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Control Temperature Schedule Name 
HeatingControlTemperatureScheduleName
```
This field specifies the heating setpoint or control temperature for the radiant system in degrees Celsius. Used in conjunction with the previous field (heating control throttling range), it will define whether or not the system is running and the current flow rate. Water flow rate to the system is varied linearly around the setpoint temperature based on the throttling range and the maximum heating flow rate parameters (see above). It should be noted that this control schedule will allow different setpoint temperatures throughout the year for heating. The control of the radiant system is based solely on the heating control temperature schedule, the cooling control temperature schedule (see below), and the control temperature type listed above. The radiant system will not use any zone thermostat that might be used by other systems serving the zone in which the radiant system resides.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Design Capacity Method 
CoolingDesignCapacityMethod
```
Enter the method used to determine the cooling design capacity for scalable sizing. Input allowed is either {CoolingDesignCapacity}, {CapacityPerFloorArea}, and {FractionOfAutosizedCoolingCapacity}. If this input field is left blank or zero, then autosizing is assumed. {CoolingDesignCapacity} means user specifies the design cooling capacity or the program calculates the design cooling capacity if autosize is specified. {CapacityPerFloorArea} means the program calculates the design cooling capacity from user specified heating capacity per floor area and floor area of the zone served by the low temperature radiant variable flow unit. {FractionOfAutosizedCoolingCapacity} means the program calculates the design cooling capacity from user specified fraction and the auto-sized design cooling capacity. The default method is {CoolingDesignCapacity}.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Design Capacity Per Floor Area {W/m2} 
CoolingDesignCapacityPerFloorAreaWM2
```
Enter the cooling capacity per unit floor area in m3/s-m2 of low temperature radiant variable flow unit. This field is required field when the Cooling Design Capacity Method is {CapacityPerFloorArea}. The program calculates the cooling capacity from floor area of the zone served by the low temperature radiant variable flow unit and the cooling capacity per unit floor area value specified by the user. This field may be left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Fraction of Autosized Cooling Design Capacity 
FractionOfAutosizedCoolingDesignCapacity
```
Enter the cooling capacity as a fraction of the autosized cooling capacity for low temperature radiant variable flow unit. This input field is required when the Cooling Design Capacity Method is {FractionOfAutosizedCoolingCapacity}. The program calculates the cooling capacity from the design autosized cooling capacity and user specified fraction. Design day sizing run must be specified. This field may be left blank. Default value is 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Control Throttling Range 
CoolingControlThrottlingRange
```
This field specifies the range of temperature in degrees Celsuis over which the radiant system throttles from zero flow rate up to the maximum defined by the maximum cold water flow rate field described above. The throttling range parameter is used in conjunction with the control temperature and the setpoint type to define the response of the system to various conditions. The Cooling Control Temperature Schedule specifies the ``setpoint'' temperature that is to be met.  This is used in conjunction with the Setpoint Type which defines whether the flow rate of the system is at zero flow or half flow when the parameter defined by the Temperature Control Type is equal to the setpoint temperature defined by the Cooling Control Temperature Schedule.  See these other input parameters of this radiant system for more information on these different parameters.  Note that when the throttling range is set to zero that this approximates an on-off system that is either fully on or totally off.
For clarity, here is an example of how the flow rate to the system will be set.  In this example, it is assumed that cooling control temperature setpoint is currently 25°C, the cooling throttling range is 2°C, and that the setpoint type is HalfFlowPower.  The water flow rate to the radiant system will be zero when the controlling temperature (MAT, MRT, Operative Temperature, etc.; see control type field above) is at or below 24°C and the maximum flow rate when the controlling temperature is at or above 26°C. This represents a throttling range of 2°C around the setpoint of 25°C. In between 24°C and 26°C, the flow rate to the radiant system is varied linearly from zero flow at a control temperature of 24°C to half flow at 15°C to full flow at w6°C.  If the throttling range is changed to 0°C or on-off control, then the system will be on above 25°C and off below 25°C.  However, if the throttling range is kept at 2°C and the setpoint type is changed to ZeroFlowPower, then the system will vary the flow linearly between zero for when the control temperature is at 25°C to full flow at 27°C.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Control Temperature Schedule Name 
CoolingControlTemperatureScheduleName
```
This field specifies the cooling setpoint or control temperature for the radiant system in degrees Celsius. Used in conjunction with the previous field (cooling control throttling range), it will define whether or not the system is running and the current flow rate. Water flow rate to the system is varied linearly around the setpoint temperature based on the throttling range and the maximum cooling flow rate parameters (see above). It should be noted that this control schedule will allow different setpoint temperatures throughout the year for cooling. The control of the radiant system is based solely on the heating control temperature schedule listed above, the cooling control temperature schedule, and the control temperature type listed above. The radiant system will not use any zone thermostat that might be used by other systems serving the zone in which the radiant system resides.
```
	
##  Field: Condensation Control Type 
CondensationControlType
```
When radiant systems do cooling, there is the possibility that condensation will occur on the surface that is being cooled. This is due to the fact that the surface temperature may drop below the dew-point temperature of the space. When this happens, condensation on the surface will occur. There are three options for handling this situation: Off, SimpleOff, and VariableOff. This parameter is optional and will default to SimpleOff.
	
	Off - EnergyPlus will not do anything other than produce a warning message when condensation is predicted to occur. The program will simply continue on, no moisture will be removed from the zone air, and there will be no adjustment of the surface temperature as a result of the condensation.
	
	SimpleOff - the program will predict cases where condensation will occur and shut-off the radiant system to avoid this situation. With this option, the users also have the opportunity to adjust when the system will shut down. This is specified with the next parameter (field: Condensation Control Dewpoint Offset).
	
	VariableOff - the program will determine whether condensation is predicted for the flow rate determined by the unit control scheme.  If condensation is predicted, the unit makes one attempt to reduce the flow rate using linear interpolation between the controlled flow rate and a zero flow rate to achieve a surface temperature that would match the dew-point temperature modified by the condensation control dew-point offset (field: Condensation Control Dewpoint Offset). For example, if the controlled flow rate results in a surface temperature of 10°C, a zero flow rate results in a surface temperature of 12°C, and the modified condensation dew-point temperature is 11°C, then the reduced flow rate would be half of the controlled flow rate.  If this reduced flow approximation does not result in condensation, then this reduced flow is used for the unit.  If the reduced flow approximation still results in condensation, then the unit is turned off to avoid excessive iterations.
```
	
##  Field: Condensation Control Dewpoint Offset 
CondensationControlDewpointOffset
```
This optional parameter is only valid with the SimpleOff and VariableOff condensation handling algorithm (see previous input parameter). It establishes the difference between the calculated dew-point temperature of the space and the allowed surface temperature to which the surface can drop before the radiant system shuts down (SimpleOff) or reduces its flow rate (VariableOff) to avoid condensation in degrees Celsius. This parameter can be any positive, negative, or zero value. When this parameter is zero, the radiant system will shut down or reduce the flow rate when the surface temperature drops to the dew-point temperature or below. When this parameter is positive, the radiant system will shut down or reduce the flow rate when the surface is the number of degrees Celsius above the dew-point temperature. This allows some extra safety to avoid condensation. When this parameter is negative, the radiant system will shut down or reduce the flow rate when the surface temperature is the number of degrees Celsius below the dew-point temperature. While not recommended, this strategy allows the user to simulate a situation where small amounts of condensation are tolerable.  The default value for this parameter is 1°C.
```
	
##  Field: Changeover Delay Time Period Schedule 
ChangeoverDelayTimePeriodSchedule
```
This field defines a schedule which should be populated with values for the amount of time in hours that is required before this low temperature radiant system can switch between either heating or cooling and the opposite conditioning mode.  If this schedule value is set to 1 (hour) at a particular time and the system was previously in heating mode, then it will be locked out from switching into cooling mode until at least one hour of time has passed in the simulation with the system ``not operating''.  This helps avoid systems bouncing back and forth between the two conditioning modes in successive time steps.  This parameter can be set to any positive value, and a zero or negative value will be assumed to have no delay (equivalent to a delay of zero).  If the user leaves this field blank, EnergyPlus will assume that no changeover delay is requested (also equivalent to a delay of zero).

# ZoneHVACLowTemperatureRadiantConstantFlow

`ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:ConstantFlow`
```
This low temperature radiant system (hydronic) is a component of zone equipment that is intended to model any ``radiant system'' where water is used to supply/remove energy to/from a building surface (wall, ceiling, or floor). The component is controlled via control schedules as described in the syntax below and does not require a zone thermostat. Note that because this unit does not require a thermostat that in cases where no other systems are serving the zone in which this system resides that it will use the heating equipment priority to determine which system will run first.~ If the radiant system is serving a zone with forced air equipment, the radiant system will follow the priority order established by the zone thermostat but will still base its response on the controls defined by the user for the radiant system.
The constant flow system differs from the variable flow system describe above in what it controls. The variable flow system varies the flow rate through the radiant system based on some control temperature. The constant flow system keeps flow rate through the radiant system constant.  In order to meet the zone load, the constant flow system will varies the water temperature that is sent to the radiant system. This is accomplished with a mixing valve that is controlled by a sensor and a local recirculation pump. This model covers a wide range of low temperature radiant systems: heating and/or cooling, panel or embedded pipes, etc. It is not intended to simulate high temperature electric or gas radiant heaters. Those devices will be handled by a separate model and different input syntax. Low temperature radiant systems that use electric resistance heating should also be defined using separate input syntax (ref: {ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:Electric}). Low temperature radiant systems that vary the flow rate through the radiant system should also be defined using separate input syntax (ref: {ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:VariableFlow}).
One of the other differences between this model and the variable flow low temperature radiant system is that the constant flow system has a built-in local secondary loop. It will recirculate flow coming out of the system and mix this with flow from the loop to arrive at the desired inlet temperature to the radiant system (note that this model has the temperature sensor AFTER the pump to insure proper inlet temperature to the radiant system). The local loop also contains a pump which is assumed to be upstream of the radiant system and after the mixing valve. So, the local loop can have some recirculation. The flow from the main loop may also bypass the radiant system if more than enough flow is available and the main loop is also a constant flow system.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This field is an unique user assigned name for an instance of a constant flow low temperature radiant system. Any reference to this unit by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Design Object 
DesignObject
```
The name of the object that holds design data for this instance of constant flow low temperature radiant system. Multiple input data values is taken from this object. For more details about the design object input parameters, please refer to the {ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:ConstantFlow:Design} section.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This field is the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the constant flow low temperature radiant system can run during a given time period. A schedule value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for that time period. A value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) denotes that the unit is available to operate during that time period. If this field is left blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Name 
ZoneName
```
This field is the name of the zone (Ref: Zone) in which the constant flow low temperature radiant system is principally located and intended to affect. A system that is between two zones will still act upon each zone; however, the zone name referenced here should be the zone that controls the radiant system response.
```
	
##  Field: Surface Name or Radiant Surface Group Name 
SurfaceNameOrRadiantSurfaceGroupName
```
This field is the name of the surface (Ref: {BuildingSurface:Detailed}) or surface list (Ref: {ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:SurfaceGroup}) in which the hydronic tubing is embedded/contained. This specification attaches the source or sink from the radiant system to a particular surface and the contribution of the system to the heat balances of that surface. If this field is a surface list, then the source or sink is attached to all of the surfaces in the list with the radiant system surface group defining the breakdown of how flow rate is split between the various surfaces. Note also that surfaces in a list do not need to be in the same zone or in the zone being served by this system (see previous field). Base surfaces (e.g., {BuildingSurface:Detailed}), door surfaces and internal mass are valid. Window surfaces are not valid surface types for embedded radiant systems.
```
	
##  Field: Hydronic Tubing Length 
HydronicTubingLength
```
This field is the total length of pipe embedded in the surface named above in the surface name field. The length of the tube should be entered in meters and is used to determine the effectiveness of heat transfer from the fluid being circulated through the tubes and the tube/surface. Longer tubing lengths result in more heat will be transferred to/from the radiant surface to the circulating fluid. Note that if the user elects to autosize this field that a standard zone thermostat such as would be used for a forced air system must be defined as autosizing calculations are based on the zone thermostat value and not on the radiant system control values. In addition, when the user opts to autosize this calculation, the tube spacing from the construction of each surface associated with this system is used along with each individual surface area to make an approximation of the tubing length.
```
	
##  Field: Rated Flow Rate 
RatedFlowRate
```
This field is the maximum flow rate of water through the radiant system in m^{3}/sec.~This flow rate is held constant by the local component pump, but the user has the option of varying this flow rate via a schedule (see next input field). The constant flow system will accept this flow rate and control the inlet temperature based on the control and water temperature schedules defined below. This field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: Pump Flow Rate Schedule Name 
PumpFlowRateScheduleName
```
This field modifies the maximum flow rate of water through the radiant system in m^{3}/sec.~This input is ``optional''. If the user does not enter a schedule, the flow rate through the radiant system is assumed to be constant during all hours that it is operating based on the value entered in the previous input field. Note that the values for this schedule must be between zero and one. The values in this schedule are multipliers on the previous field -- Rated Flow Rate.

Water and control temperatures for heating work together to provide a linear function that determines the water temperature sent to the radiant system. The current control temperature (see Temperature Control Type above) is compared to the high and low control temperatures at the current time. If the control temperature is above the high temperature, then the system will be turned off and the water mass flow rate will be zero. If the control temperature is below the low temperature, then the inlet water temperature is set to the high water temperature. If the control temperature is between the high and low value, then the inlet water temperature is linearly interpolated between the low and high water temperature values.~ For more information and a graph of how the water and control schedules affect the system operation, please consult the Engineering Reference document.

It establishes the difference between the calculated dew-point temperature of the space and the allowed surface temperature to which the surface can drop before the radiant system shuts down (SimpleOff) or tries to adjust the inlet water temperature (VariableOff) in degrees Celsius. This parameter can be any positive, negative, or zero value. When this parameter is zero, the radiant system will shut down or adjust the inlet water temperature when the surface temperature drops to the dew-point temperature or below. When this parameter is positive, the radiant system will shut down or increase the inlet water temperature when the surface is the number of degrees Celsius above the dew-point temperature. This allows some extra safety to avoid condensation. When this parameter is negative, the radiant system will shut down or increase the inlet water temperature when the surface temperature is the number of degrees Celsius below the dew-point temperature. While not recommended, this strategy allows the user to simulate a situation where small amounts of condensation are tolerable. The default value for this parameter is 1°C.
```
	
##  Field: Number of Circuits 
NumberOfCircuits
```
This optional input allows the user to choose between modeling each surface in the radiant system as a single hydronic circuit or to allow the program to divide the surface into multiple parallel hydronic circuits based on the next input field {Circuit Length}. To model as a single circuit choose {OnePerSurface}. To model as multiple circuits choose {CalculateFromCircuitLength}. It is recommended that {CalculateFromCircuitLength} be chosen. The default is {OnePerSurface} for backward compatibility with older versions of EnergyPlus.
```
	
##  Field: Circuit Length 
CircuitLength
```
The length in meters of each parallel hydronic circuit in a surface. Used when the previous input field is set to {CalculateFromCircuitLength}. The default is 106.7 meters (350 feet), which is the maximum circuit length allowed in Title 24.

# ZoneHVACLowTemperatureRadiantConstantFlowDesign

`ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:ConstantFlow:Design`
```
This object contains the design fields for {ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:ConstantFlow}.
The information from one ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:ConstantFlow:Design object can be shared with several ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:ConstantFlow objects.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This field is an unique user assigned name for an instance of a constant flow low temperature radiant system design object. Any reference to this unit by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Fluid to Radiant Surface Heat Transfer Model 
FluidToRadiantSurfaceHeatTransferModel
```
This field is provides the opportunity to control how the heat transfer between the fluid circulating through this radiant system and the radiant system itself.  There are two options for this parameter: ConvectionOnly or ISOStandard.  The default value is ConvectionOnly.  More information on each of these options is provided below.
	
	ConvectionOnly - This is the default mode and the method that was implemented when the radiant model was first introduced into EnergyPlus.  In this modeling option, it is assumed that the impact of the tube material on heat exchange between the fluid and the radiant system and that only the convection between the fluid and the radiant system is the only critical heat transfer mechanism to take into account.  The reasoning behind this included the fact that there are other simplifications in the method for calculating heat transfer and that this simplification would not result in any significant difference in the simulated heat transfer performance of the system.  Convection between the fluid and the pipe wall of the system is related to physical parameters of the system (pipe/tube inner diameter and length) as well as the flow characteristics.
	
	ISOStandard - This method is based on the ISO Standard 11855, Part 2 (2012) document entitled ``Building environment design ??? Design, dimensioning, installation and control of embedded radiant heating and cooling systems ??? Part 2: Determination of the design heating and cooling capacity'', Reference Number ISO 11855-2:2012(E).  This standard recommends equations (see Appendix B of this document) to include the effects of convective heat transfer between the fluid and the inside of the piping and conduction through the pipe wall.  This model requires both the inner and outer diameter of the pipe/tube, the length of the pipe/tube, and the thermal conductivity of the pipe/tube material.  Note that as part of the implementation of this model in EnergyPlus, flow within the piping/tubing is always assumed to be turbulent.
```
	
##  Field: Temperature Control Type 
TemperatureControlType
```
This field specifies along with setpoint (control) and water schedules how the user wishes to control the constant flow radiant system. The temperature denoted in the setpoint schedule can refer to one of eight different temperatures: the zone mean air temperature, the zone mean radiant temperature, the zone operative temperature, the outdoor dry-bulb temperature, the outdoor wet-bulb temperature, the radiant surface inside face temperature, the radiant surface interior temperature, or the running mean outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The choice of temperature is controlled by the current field---temperature control type. The user must select from the following options:
	
	MeanAirTemperature - The mean air temperature of the zone being controlled by this radiant system.
	
	MeanRadiantTemperature - The mean radiant temperature of the zone being controlled by this radiant system.
	
	OperativeTemperature - The operative temperature of the zone being controlled by the radiant system. Operative temperature for radiant system controls is the average of Mean Air Temperature and Mean Radiant Temperature.
	
	OutdoorDryBulbTemperature - The outdoor dry-bulb temperature of the current outdoor environment.
	
	OutdoorWetBulbTemperature - The outdoor wet-bulb temperature of the current outdoor environment.
	
	SurfaceFaceTemperature - This option allows the user to control the radiant system using the inside face surface temperature of the radiant system (the inside surface temperature).
	
	SurfaceInteriorTemperature - This option will allow the user to control the radiant system using a surface temperature that is calculated inside the radiant system.  This point will be defined by the  {Construction:InternalSource} description for the system.  In that input, the user has the option to calculate a temperature at a particular point in the construction.  The radiant system will then use this information for controlling the slab not just producing temperatures for outputting at that point.  Users should consult the input for Field: Temperature Calculation Requested After Layer Number for more information.  Note that for the SurfaceFaceTemperature and SurfaceInteriorTemperature the surface being used for control is the surface listed in {Field: Surface Name or Radiant Surface Group Name}.  If the user enters a group of surfaces for that input, the {first} surface in the radiant group is the surface for control purposes.
	
	RunningMeanOutdoorDryBulbTemperature - This option will allow the user to control the inlet water temperature to the system as a function of the running mean outdoor air temperature.  The next field ({Running Mean Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature Weighting Factor}) will define how this temperature is actually calculated within EnergyPlus.
If the user does not select a control type, {MeanAirTemperature} control is assumed by EnergyPlus. See the throttling range and control temperature schedule fields below for more information on how the setpoint temperature is established for this particular radiant system.
```
	
##  Field: Running Mean Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature Weighting Factor 
RunningMeanOutdoorDryBulbTemperatureWeightingFactor
```
This field specifies the weighting factor that is used to calculate the running mean outdoor dry-bulb temperature.  The running mean outdoor dry-bulb temperature is determined using the following equation:
	\Theta_{rm} = (1 - \alpha) \Theta_{ed-1} + \alpha \Theta_{rm-1}
	\label{eq:RunningMeanOutdoorDryBulbTemperatureEquation}
where:
\Theta_{rm} is the current running mean outdoor dry-bulb temperature that is used to control the radiant system
\Theta_{ed-1} is the average outdoor dry-bulb temperature from the previous day
\Theta_{rm-1} is the running mean outdoor dry-bulb temperature from the previous day
\alpha is the user defined weighting factor that is defined by this field.  It controls the weighting of the running mean outdoor dry-bulb temperature from the previous day and the average outdoor dry-bulb temperature from the previous day for the purposes of calculating the running mean outdoor dry-bulb temperature for the current day.  The value for this weighting factor must be between zero and 1.
```
	
##  Field: Hydronic Tubing Inside Diameter 
HydronicTubingInsideDiameter
```
This field is the inside diameter of the tubes through which the fluid is circulated for the system being defined by this statement. The inner diameter should be recorded in meters and is used to determine the convective heat transfer from the water to the inside surface of the hydronic tubing.  The default for this parameter is 0.013 which is approximately equivalent to the inner diameter of a typical 1/2 PEX pipe size.
```
	
##  Field: Hydronic Tubing Outside Diameter 
HydronicTubingOutsideDiameter
```
This field is the outside diameter of the tubes through which the fluid is circulated for the system being defined by this statement. The outer diameter should be recorded in meters and is used to determine the conduction through the hydronic tubing and the contact resistance between the tube/pipe and the radiant system itself in the ISOStandard option for the Fluid to Radiant Surface Heat Transfer Model (see above).  The default for this parameter is 0.016 which is approximately equivalent to the outer diameter a typical 1/2 PEX pipe size.
```
	
##  Field: Hydronic Tubing Conductivity 
HydronicTubingConductivity
```
This field is the thermal conductivity of the pipe/tube that is used in this radiant system in Watts per meter-Kelvin (W/m-K).  It is used to calculate the resistance to heat transfer through the pipe/tube wall in the ISOStandard option for the Fluid to Radiant Surface Heat Transfer Model (see above).  The default for this parameter is 0.35 which is the value given for PEX piping in ISO Standard 11855-2(2012).
```
	
##  Field: Motor Efficiency 
MotorEfficiency
```
This numeric field contains the pump motor's efficiency in decimal form (0 = 0%, 1 = 100%).
```
	
##  Field: Fraction of Motor Inefficiencies to Fluid Stream 
FractionOfMotorInefficienciesToFluidStream
```
This numeric field contains the pump motor's fraction of power loss to the fluid.
```
	
##  Field: Condensation Control Type 
CondensationControlType
```
When radiant systems do cooling, there is the possibility that condensation will occur on the surface that is being cooled. This is due to the fact that the surface temperature may drop below the dew-point temperature of the space. When this happens, condensation on the surface will occur. There are three options for handling this situation: Off, SimpleOff, and VariableOff. This parameter is optional and will default to SimpleOff.
	
	Off - EnergyPlus will not do anything other than produce a warning message when condensation is predicted to occur. The program will simply continue on; no moisture will be removed from the zone air and there will be no adjustment of the surface temperature as a result of the condensation.
	
	SimpleOff - the program will predict cases where condensation will occur and shut-off the radiant system to avoid this situation. With this option, the users also have the opportunity to adjust when the system will shut down. This is specified with the next parameter (field: Condensation Control Dewpoint Offset).
	
	VariableOff - the program will determine whether condensation is predicted for the flow rate determined by the unit control scheme.  If condensation is predicted, the unit makes one attempt to avoid condensation by increasing the water inlet temperature to the system to match the dew-point temperature modified by the condensation control dew-point offset (field: Condensation Control Dewpoint Offset). For example, if a surface in the space is predicted to be 15°C and the modified condensation dew-point temperature is 17°C, then the inlet water temperature to the unit is reset to 17°C and the system is simulated again with this new inlet water temperature.  If this increased inlet water temperature does not result in condensation, then the simulation continues using this operating condition for the system.  If the increased inlet water temperature still results in condensation, then the unit is turned off to avoid excessive iterations.
```
	
##  Field: Condensation Control Dewpoint Offset 
CondensationControlDewpointOffset
```
This optional parameter is only valid with the SimpleOff and VariableOff condensation handling algorithm (see previous input parameter). It establishes the difference between the calculated dew-point temperature of the space and the allowed surface temperature to which the surface can drop before the radiant system shuts down (SimpleOff) or reduces its flow rate (VariableOff) to avoid condensation in degrees Celsius. This parameter can be any positive, negative, or zero value. When this parameter is zero, the radiant system will shut down or reduce the flow rate when the surface temperature drops to the dew-point temperature or below. When this parameter is positive, the radiant system will shut down or reduce the flow rate when the surface is the number of degrees Celsius above the dew-point temperature. This allows some extra safety to avoid condensation. When this parameter is negative, the radiant system will shut down or reduce the flow rate when the surface temperature is the number of degrees Celsius below the dew-point temperature. While not recommended, this strategy allows the user to simulate a situation where small amounts of condensation are tolerable.  The default value for this parameter is 1°C.
```
	
##  Field: Changeover Delay Time Period Schedule 
ChangeoverDelayTimePeriodSchedule
```
This field defines a schedule which should be populated with values for the amount of time in hours that is required before this low temperature radiant system can switch between either heating or cooling and the opposite conditioning mode.  If this schedule value is set to 1 (hour) at a particular time and the system was previously in heating mode, then it will be locked out from switching into cooling mode until at least one hour of time has passed in the simulation with the system``not operating''.  This helps avoid systems bouncing back and forth between the two conditioning modes in successive time steps.  This parameter can be set to any positive value, and a zero or negative value will be assumed to have no delay (equivalent to a delay of zero).  If the user leaves this field blank, EnergyPlus will assume that no changeover delay is requested (also equivalent to a delay of zero).
An example IDF with a design object for constant flow low temperature radiant system is shown below.

# ZoneHVACLowTemperatureRadiantElectric

`ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:Electric`
```
This low temperature radiant system (electric) is a component of zone equipment that is intended to model any ``radiant system'' where electric resistance heating is used to supply energy (heat) to a building surface (wall, ceiling, or floor). The component is controlled by the radiant system controls that are defined in the syntax below and this control does not require the use of a zone thermostat unless the unit is being autosized. Note also that because this unit does not require a thermostat that in cases where no other systems are serving the zone in which this system resides that it will use the heating equipment priority to determine which system will run first. If the radiant system is serving a zone with forced air equipment, the radiant system will follow the priority order established by the zone thermostat but will still base its response on the controls defined by the user for the radiant system.
The control is accomplished by varying the electrical power supplied to the unit. This model covers either a radiant panel system or wires embedded in entire walls, floors, or ceilings. It is not intended to simulate high temperature electric or gas radiant heaters. Those devices will be handled by a separate model (ref: {ZoneHVAC:HighTemperatureRadiant}) and different input syntax. Low temperature radiant systems that use water flowing through tubes to provide heat to the system should also be defined using separate input syntax (ref: {ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:VariableFlow} or {ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:ConstantFlow}).
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This field is an unique user assigned name for an instance of an electric low temperature radiant system. Any reference to this unit by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This field is the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the electric low temperature radiant system can operate during a given time period. A schedule value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for that time period. A value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) denotes that the unit is available to operate during that time period. If this field is left blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Name 
ZoneName
```
This field is the name of the zone (Ref: Zone) in which the electric low temperature radiant system is principally located and intended to affect. A system that is between two zones will still act upon each zone; however, the zone name referenced here should be the zone that controls the radiant system response.
```
	
##  Field: Surface Name or Radiant Surface Group Name 
SurfaceNameOrRadiantSurfaceGroupName
```
This field is the name of the surface (Ref: BuildingSurface) or surface list (Ref: {ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:SurfaceGroup}) in which the heating element is embedded/contained. This specification attaches the source or sink from the radiant system to a particular surface and the contribution of the system to the heat balances of that surface. If this field is a surface list, then the source or sink is attached to all of the surfaces in the list with the radiant system surface group defining the breakdown of how energy flow is split between the various surfaces. Note also that surfaces in a list do not need to be in the same zone or in the zone being served by this system (see previous field). Base surfaces (e.g., {BuildingSurface:Detailed}, {Wall:Detailed}, {RoofCeiling:Detailed}, etc.), door surfaces and internal mass are valid. Window surfaces are not valid surface types for embedded radiant systems.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Design Capacity Method 
HeatingDesignCapacityMethod
```
Enter the method used to determine the maximum electrical power (heating design capacity ) or enter the method for scalable sizing the maximum electrical power of low temperature radiant electric unit. Input allowed is either {HeatingDesignCapacity}, {CapacityPerFloorArea}, and {FractionOfAutosizedHeatingCapacity}. If this input field is left blank or zero, then autosizing is assumed. {HeatingDesignCapacity} means user specifies the magnitude of maximum or nominal heating capacity or the program calculates the maximum or nominal design heating capacity if autosize is specified. {CapacityPerFloorArea} means the program calculates the design heating capacity from user specified heating capacity per floor area and floor area of the zone served by the low temperature radiant electric unit. {FractionOfAutosizedHeatingCapacity} means the program calculates the design heating capacity from user specified fraction and the auto-sized design heating capacity. The default method is {HeatingDesignCapacity}.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Design Capacity {W} 
HeatingDesignCapacityW
```
This field is for the maximum amount of electric energy rate (electric power) converted into heat in low temperature radiant electric unit in watts. This input field is autosizable. The controls for the radiant system will vary the amount of power supplied to the surface between zero input and the maximum power specified in this field as the lower and upper bounds, respectively. Note that if the user elects to autosize this field that a standard zone thermostat such as would be used for a forced air system must be defined as autosizing calculations are based on the zone thermostat value and not on the low temperature radiant electric unit control values. The default input for this input field is autosize.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Design Capacity Per Floor Area {W/m2} 
HeatingDesignCapacityPerFloorAreaWM2
```
Enter the heating capacity per unit floor area in m3/s-m2 of low temperature radiant electric system. This field is required field when the Heating Design Capacity Method is {CapacityPerFloorArea}. The program calculates the heating capacity from floor area of the zone served by the low temperature radiant electric unit and the heating capacity per unit floor area value specified by the user. This field may be left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Fraction of Autosized Heating Design Capacity 
FractionOfAutosizedHeatingDesignCapacity
```
Enter the heating capacity as a fraction of the autosized heating capacity of low temperature radiant electric unit. This input field is required when the Heating Design Capacity Method is {FractionOfAutosizedHeatingCapacity}. The program calculates the heating capacity from the design autosized heating capacity and user specified fraction. Design day sizing must be specified. This field may be left blank. The default value is 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Temperature Control Type 
TemperatureControlType
```
This field specifies along with setpoint (control) and water schedules how the user wishes to control the constant flow radiant system. The temperature denoted in the setpoint schedule can refer to one of seven different temperatures: the zone mean air temperature, the zone mean radiant temperature, the zone operative temperature, the outdoor dry-bulb temperature, the outdoor wet-bulb temperature, the radiant surface inside face temperature, or the radiant surface interior temperature. The choice of temperature is controlled by the current field--temperature control type. The user must select from the following options:
  MeanAirTemperature - The mean air temperature of the zone being controlled by this radiant system.
  MeanRadiantTemperature - The mean radiant temperature of the zone being controlled by this radiant system.
  OperativeTemperature - The operative temperature of the zone being controlled by the radiant system. Operative temperature for radiant system controls is the average of Mean Air Temperature and Mean Radiant Temperature.  
  OutdoorDryBulbTemperature - The outdoor dry-bulb temperature of the current outdoor environment.
  OutdoorWetBulbTemperature - The outdoor wet-bulb temperature of the current outdoor environment.
  SurfaceFaceTemperature - This option allows the user to control the radiant system using the inside face surface temperature of the radiant system (the inside surface temperature).
 SurfaceInteriorTemperature - This option will allow the user to control
      the radiant system using a surface temperature that is calculated inside
      the radiant system.  This point will be defined by the
      {ConstructionProperty:InternalHeatSource}
      description for the system.  In that input, the user has the option to
      calculate a temperature at a particular point in the construction.  The
      radiant system will then use this information for controlling the slab
      not just producing temperatures for outputting at that point.  Users
      should consult the input for Field: Temperature Calculation Requested
      After Layer Number for more information.  Note that for the
      SurfaceFaceTemperature and SurfaceInteriorTemperature the surface being
      used for control is the surface listed in {Field: Surface Name or Radiant Surface Group Name}.  If the user enters a group of surfaces for that input, the
      {first} surface in the radiant group is the surface for control
      purposes.
If the user does not select a control type, {MeanAirTemperature} control is assumed by EnergyPlus. See the throttling range and control temperature schedule fields below for more information on how the setpoint temperature is established for this particular radiant system.
```
	
##  Field: Setpoint Control Type 
SetpointControlType
```
This field has two options (ZeroFlowPower and HalfFlowPower) and is used to determine the response of the low temperature radiant system at the setpoint temperature.  The Heating Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name (see below) defines a schedule for a temperature setpoint.  The previous field (Temperature Control Type) defines which temperature is being controlled to that setpoint.  This field determines the response of the system when the temperature being controlled is at the temperature setpoint.  When ZeroFlowPower is chosen for this field, then the system will assume that it should shut off when the temperature controlled arrives at the setpoint.  So, if Mean Air Temperature control is used and it becomes equal to the setpoint temperature, then the system will turn off.  When HalfFlowPower is chosen for this field, then the system will assume that it should be at half of the maximum water flow when it achieves the setpoint condition.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Throttling Range 
HeatingThrottlingRange
```
This field specifies the range of temperature in degrees Celsuis over which the radiant system throttles from zero flow heat input via the electric resistance wires up to the maximum defined by the maximum electrical power field described above. The throttling range parameter is used in conjunction with the control temperature and the setpoint type to define the response of the system to various conditions. The Heating Setpoint Temperature Schedule specifies the ``setpoint'' temperature that is to be met.  This is used in conjunction with the Setpoint Type which defines whether the flow rate of the system is at zero heat input or half heat input when the parameter defined by the Temperature Control Type is equal to the setpoint temperature defined by the Heating Control Temperature Schedule.  See these other input parameters of this radiant system for more information on these different parameters.  Note that when the throttling range is set to zero that this approximates an on-off system that is either fully on or totally off.
For clarity, here is an example of how the heat input fraction (of the unit capacity) to the system will be set.  In this example, it is assumed that heating control temperature setpoint is currently 15°C, the heating throttling range is 2°C, and that the setpoint type is HalfFlowPower.  The heat input rate to the radiant system will be zero when the controlling temperature (MAT, MRT, Operative Temperature, etc.; see control type field above) is at or above 16°C and the maximum heat input when the controlling temperature is at or below 14°C. This represents a throttling range of 2°C around the setpoint of 15°C. In between 14°C and 16°C, the heat input rate to the radiant system is varied linearly from full heat input at a control temperature of 14°C to half heat input at 15°C to zero heat input at 16°C.  If the throttling range is changed to 0°C or on-off control, then the system will be off above 15°C and on below 15°C.  However, if the throttling range is kept at 2°C and the setpoint type is changed to ZeroFlowPower, then the system will vary the heat input linearly between zero for when the control temperature is at 15°C to full heat input at 13°C.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name 
HeatingSetpointTemperatureScheduleName
```
This field specifies the heating setpoint or control temperature for the radiant system in degrees Celsius. Used in conjunction with the previous field (heating throttling range), it will define whether or not the system is running and the current power input to the radiant surface. Power input to the system is varied linearly around the setpoint temperature based on the throttling range and the maximum electrical power parameters (see above). It should be noted that this control schedule will allow different setpoint temperatures throughout the year for heating. In addition, this schedule may be different that the thermostatic control schedule defined for overall operation of components serving the zone in which the radiant system is located. The thermostatic control determines whether or not there is a heating or cooling load in the space and thus whether the systems should be operating. This field simply controls the flow rate to the radiant system.

# ZoneHVACLowTemperatureRadiantSurfaceGroup

`ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:SurfaceGroup`
```
A low temperature radiant system (hydronic or electric) may consist of multiple active surfaces that serve to condition the space. Surfaces that act serially can be specified as multiple radiant systems using the standard radiant system input described above. However, if the multiple surfaces act in parallel, the Radiant System Surface Group input line is used to specify which surfaces are acting in a coordinated fashion and how energy flow is split between the surfaces. This list of surfaces (the name it is assigned) replaces the name of a single surface in the radiant system input described above. Note that all of the surfaces within a single list do not need to be in the same zone so the zones of these surfaces do not need to match the zone the radiant system is attempting to condition. Keep in mind, however, that if the surfaces within a single surface group do not reside in the zone that these zones must all have the same zone multipliers.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This field is an unique user assigned name for the list of surfaces that are acting in coordination with one another. Any reference to this list by a radiant system will use this name.
```
	
##  Field Set: Surface Name, Flow Fraction to Surface 
SetSurfaceNameFlowFractionToSurface
```
The pairs of Surface Name, Flow Fraction to Surface are used in several objects. There can be up to 10 specified. This object is extensible, so additional pairs of these fields can be added to the end of this object.
```
	
##  Field: Surface <x> Name 
SurfaceXName
```
This field is the name of a surface being conditioned by the radiant system. It should be noted that the surfaces listed in this field do {not} need to be present in the zone being served by the radiant system to which this surface is related. This allows radiant systems to span more than one zone and have surfaces controlled by conditions in another zone. When the user does select surfaces that are in different zones than the zone being served by the radiant system, a warning message is generated to alert the user that the surface is not in the same zone as the zone being served by the radiant system. If this is the intent of the user, this warning message can be ignored. Base surfaces (e.g., {BuildingSurface:Detailed}), door surfaces and internal mass are valid. Window surfaces are not valid surface types for embedded radiant systems.
```
	
##  Field: Flow Fraction for Surface <x> 
FlowFractionForSurfaceX
```
This field is the fraction of the total radiant system flow rate that is being sent to this particular surface. Note that the Surface Name/Surface Flow Fraction pair can be repeated up to 10 times. Flow rate fractions must sum to unity, otherwise the program will not accept the input as valid.
An example IDF with an electric low temperature radiant system is shown below.

# ZoneHVACHighTemperatureRadiant

`ZoneHVAC:HighTemperatureRadiant`
```
The high temperature radiant system (gas-fired or electric) is a component of zone equipment that is intended to model any ``high temperature'' or ``high intensity'' radiant system where electric resistance or gas-fired combustion heating is used to supply energy (heat) to a building occupants directly as well as the building surfaces (wall, ceiling, or floor). The component is controlled by the radiant system controls defined in the syntax below and this control does not require the use of a zone thermostat unless the unit is being autosized. Note also that because this unit does not require a thermostat that in cases where no other systems are serving the zone in which this system resides that it will use the heating equipment priority to determine which system will run first.~ If the radiant system is serving a zone with forced air equipment, the radiant system will follow the priority order established by the zone thermostat but will still base its response on the controls defined by the user for the radiant system.
The control is accomplished by varying the electrical power supplied to or gas consumed by the unit. It is not intended to simulate low temperature electric or hydronic radiant systems. Those devices will be handled by a separate model and different input syntax (ref: the low temperature systems described elsewhere).
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This field is an unique user assigned name for an instance of the high temperature radiant system. Any reference to this unit by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This field is the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the high temperature radiant system can operate during a given time period. A schedule value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for that time period. A value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) denotes that the unit is available to operate during that time period. If this field is left blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Name 
ZoneName
```
This field is the name of the zone (Ref: Zone) in which the high temperature radiant system is principally located and intended to affect.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Design Capacity Method 
HeatingDesignCapacityMethod
```
Enter the method used to determine the maximum electrical power (heating design capacity ) or enter the method for scalable sizing the maximum electrical power of high temperature radiant system unit. Input allowed is either {HeatingDesignCapacity}, {CapacityPerFloorArea}, and {FractionOfAutosizedHeatingCapacity}. If this input field is left blank or zero, then autosizing is assumed. {HeatingDesignCapacity} means user specifies the magnitude of maximum or nominal heating capacity or the program calculates the maximum or nominal design heating capacity if autosize is specified. {CapacityPerFloorArea} means the program calculates the design heating capacity from user specified heating capacity per floor area and floor area of the zone served by the high temperature radiant electric unit. {FractionOfAutosizedHeatingCapacity} means the program calculates the design heating capacity from user specified fraction and the auto-sized design heating capacity. The default method is {HeatingDesignCapacity}.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Design Capacity {W} 
HeatingDesignCapacityW
```
This field is for the maximum amount of electric energy rate (electric power) converted into heat in high temperature radiant electric unit in watts. This input field is autosizable. The controls for the radiant system will vary the amount of power supplied to the surface between zero input and the maximum power specified in this field as the lower and upper bounds, respectively. Note that if the user elects to autosize this field that a standard zone thermostat such as would be used for a forced air system must be defined as autosizing calculations are based on the zone thermostat value and not on the radiant system control values. The default input for this field is autosize.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Design Capacity Per Floor Area {W/m2} 
HeatingDesignCapacityPerFloorAreaWM2
```
Enter the heating capacity per unit floor area in m3/s-m2 of high temperature radiant electric unit. This field is required field when the Heating Design Capacity Method is {CapacityPerFloorArea}. The program calculates the heating capacity from floor area of the zone served by the high temperature radiant electric unit and the heating capacity per unit floor area value specified by the user. This field may be left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Fraction of Autosized Heating Design Capacity 
FractionOfAutosizedHeatingDesignCapacity
```
Enter the heating capacity as a fraction of the autosized heating capacity for high temperature radiant electric unit. This input field is required when the Heating Design Capacity Method is {FractionOfAutosizedHeatingCapacity}. The program calculates the heating capacity from the design autosized heating capacity and user specified fraction. Design day sizing run must be specified. This field may be left blank. The default value is 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Fuel Type 
FuelType
```
This field denotes the type of high temperature radiant heater: gas or electric. The user must specify this by inputting either the keyword ``{NaturalGas}'' or ``{Electricity}'' for this field.
```
	
##  Field: Combustion Efficiency 
CombustionEfficiency
```
This field is the combustion efficiency for a gas high temperature radiant heater. This value should be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1. It is intended to take into account any potential inefficiencies in the combustion process inside the radiant heater. The heater gas consumption is the ratio of heater output over the combustion efficiency. This parameter has no meaning for an electric high temperature radiant heater and is ignored when the previous field is equal to ``Electric''.
```
	
##  Field: Fraction of Input Converted to Radiant Energy 
FractionOfInputConvertedToRadiantEnergy
```
This field specifies what fraction of the power input to the high temperature radiant heater is actually radiant heat transfer. The fraction should be between 0 and 1. In conjunction with the next two parameters, it defines the breakdown of how the power input to the heater is distributed to the rest of the zone. The sum of these fractions must be less than or equal to 1. If the fractions are less than one, the remaining energy is added to the zone as convective heat transfer. The radiant heat transfer from the heat is distributed to people and surfaces using the distribution fractions listed below.
```
	
##  Field: Fraction of Input Converted to Latent Energy 
FractionOfInputConvertedToLatentEnergy
```
This field specifies the fraction of the power input to the high temperature radiant heater that is converted to a latent heat gain within the space. This may be appropriate when a combustion process produces moisture that is transferred into the space. The latent heat addition from a high temperature radiant heater is handled as any other latent heat gain within the space, affecting the moisture balance on the zone air.
```
	
##  Field: Fraction of Input that Is Lost 
FractionOfInputThatIsLost
```
This field specifies the fraction of power input to the high temperature radiant heater that is ``lost''. This energy is a loss term, and this fraction of the input power has no effect on the zone heat balances.
```
	
##  Field: Temperature control type 
TemperatureControlType
```
This field specifies along with the throttling range and setpoint schedules how the user wishes to control the high temperature radiant system. The temperature denoted in the setpoint schedule can refer to one of three different temperatures: a mean air temperature, a mean radiant temperature, or an operative temperature. The choice of temperature is controlled by the current field---temperature control type. The user must select from the following options:
  MeanAirTemperature
  MeanRadiantTemperature
  OperativeTemperature
  MeanAirTemperatureSetpoint
  MeanRadiantTemperatureSetpoint
  OperativeTemperatureSetpoint
If the user does not select a control type, OperativeTemperature control is assumed by EnergyPlus. For the setpoint control strategies (those ending in Setpoint above), EnergyPlus will attempt to find the correct heater output to meet the heating setpoint temperature (see below) through iteration and interpolation. This will more closely match the operation of an actual thermostat, but it will require significantly longer execution times.~ For more information on the standard piecewise linear control algorithm used by the Mean Air Temperature, Mean Radiant Temperature, and Operative Temperature control types (the ``non-Setpoint'' controls), see the throttling range and control temperature schedule fields below for more information.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Throttling Range 
HeatingThrottlingRange
```
This field specifies the range of temperature in degrees Celsuis over which the radiant system throttles from zero heat input via the electric resistance wires up to the maximum defined by the maximum electrical power field described above. The throttling range parameter is used in conjunction with the control temperature (see below) to define the response of the system to various zone conditions. The heating control temperature schedule specifies the ``setpoint'' temperature where the power input to the system is at half of the maximum power input. For example, if the heating control temperature setpoint is currently 15°C and the heating throttling range is 2°C, the electrical power supplied to the radiant system will be zero when the controlling temperature (Mean Air Temperature, Mean Radiant Temperature, and Operative Temperature; see control type field above) is at or above 16°C and the maximum power input when the controlling temperature is at or below 14°C. This represents a throttling range of 2°C around the setpoint of 15°C. In between 14°C and 16°C, the power input to the radiant system is varied linearly.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name 
HeatingSetpointTemperatureScheduleName
```
This field specifies the heating setpoint or control temperature for the radiant system in degrees Celsius. Used in conjunction with the previous field (heating throttling range), it will define whether or not the system is running and the current power input to the radiant surface. Power input to the system is varied linearly around the setpoint temperature based on the throttling range and the maximum electrical power parameters (see above). It should be noted that this control schedule will allow different setpoint temperatures throughout the year for heating. In addition, this schedule may be different that the thermostatic control schedule defined for overall operation of components serving the zone in which the radiant system is located. The thermostatic control determines whether or not there is a heating or cooling load in the space and thus whether the systems should be operating. This field simply controls the flow rate to the radiant system.
```
	
##  Field: Fraction of Radiant Energy Incident on People 
FractionOfRadiantEnergyIncidentOnPeople
```
This field specifies the fraction of radiant heat transfer to the zone from the radiant heater that is incident directly on people within the space. This has an impact on the predicted thermal comfort of the zone occupants. Note that since the thermal comfort models only use the results of the zone heat balances this energy is accounted for within the heat balance as convective energy, directly affecting the zone air heat balance. The basic assumption here is that most radiant energy falling on people will most likely be convected to the surroundings. This is a simplification of reality, but it maintains the overall energy balance.
```
	
##  Field Set: Surface Name, Fraction of radiant energy to Surface 
SetSurfaceNameFractionOfRadiantEnergyToSurface
```
The pairs of Surface Name, Fraction of Radiant Energy to Surface are used in several objects. There can be up to 20 specified.
```
	
##  Field: Surface <x> Name 
SurfaceXName
```
This field is the name of the first surface to which radiant heat transfer from the high temperature radiant heater is distributed. Used in conjunction with the next field, it helps to define the distribution of the radiant energy on the surfaces within the zone. Note that up to 20 pairs of surface names and corresponding fractions may be entered for a single radiant heater system.
```
	
##  Field: Fraction of Radiant Energy to Surface <x> 
FractionOfRadiantEnergyToSurfaceX
```
This field is paired with the preceding surface name (previous field) to define the fraction of radiant heat transfer leaving the high temperature radiant system that is incident on a particular surface. Users should take into account the directionality of high temperature radiant heaters and their location when defining the value for this input field. Note that the sum of all fractions plus the fraction of radiant energy incident on people must add up to 1 so that all radiant energy is taken into account and none of it is lost.
An example IDF with a high temperature radiant system is shown below.

# ZoneHVACVentilatedSlab

`ZoneHVAC:VentilatedSlab`
```
Ventilated slab systems in general use outdoor air to ``precool'' slabs with colder nighttime air.~ This method of precooling the thermal mass of a space can be very effective when nighttime temperatures are low and the mass of the system is high enough to provide a significant amount of cooling potential during the day to counteract internal heat gains within a zone.~ Nearly all ventilated slabs are simple systems such as that shown in the right side of Figure{fig:ventilated-slab-model-basic-system}.~ The fan is shown in a blow through position, but the model will allow either a blow or draw through configuration.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This field is a unique user assigned name for an instance of a ventilated slab system. Any reference to this unit by another object will use this name. Other objects that use this ventilated slab system will reference it by this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This field is the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the ventilated slab system can run during a given time period. A schedule value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for that time period. A value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) denotes that the unit is available to operate during that time period. If this field is left blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Name 
ZoneName
```
This field is the name of the zone (Ref: Zone) in which the ventilated slab system is principally located and intended to affect. A system that is between two zones will still act upon each zone; however, the zone name referenced here should be the zone that controls the system response.
```
	
##  Field: Surface Name or Radiant Surface Group Name 
SurfaceNameOrRadiantSurfaceGroupName
```
This field is the name of the surface (Ref: Surface) or surface list (Ref: {ZoneHVAC:VentilatedSlab:SlabGroup}) in which the hollow cores are embedded/contained. This specification attaches the source or sinks from the radiant system to a particular surface and the contribution of the system to the heat balances of that surface. If this field is a surface list, then the source or sink is attached to all of the surfaces in the list with the radiant system surface group defining the breakdown of how flow rate is split between the various surfaces. Only base surfaces (Walls, Roofs, Floors) are valid. Window/Door surfaces and Internal Mass are not valid surface types for embedded radiant systems.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Air Flow Rate 
MaximumAirFlowRate
```
This field allows the user to enter the maximum volumetric flow rate of air through the ventilated slab system in m^{3}/sec.~ This parameter should be some real number greater than zero.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Control Type 
OutdoorAirControlType
```
This field allows the user to control how outdoor air is used in the ventilated slab system.~ The ventilated slab system described by this syntax has its own outdoor air handler.~ The three options for outdoor air control are ``{VariablePercent}'', ``{FixedTemperature}'' and ``{FixedAmount}''. Those keywords are the only allowed choices for this parameter.~ In general, the variable percent control will attempt to vary the amount of outdoor air between some minimum and maximum schedules of fractions (see next two fields) to best meet the current heating or cooling load. The fixed temperature control will vary the amount of outdoor air between the minimum schedule (fraction of maximum, see next field) and 100% available outdoor air to come as close as possible to a desired mixed air temperature (see two fields down) that can be scheduled. The fixed amount control will fix the outdoor air flow rate as minimum outdoor air flow rate and schedule specified by the user and automatically set the maximum and minimum outside flow rate to be equal by ignoring the maximum outdoor air flow rate. More information on the controls and operation of the ventilated slab are given in the section above (preceding the IDF description).
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Outdoor Air Flow Rate 
MinimumOutdoorAirFlowRate
```
This field allows the user to enter the minimum volumetric flow rate of outdoor air (in m^{3}/sec) that will be brought in to the ventilated slab. The actual minimum outdoor air flow rate will be this number multiplied by the schedule value from the minimum outdoor air schedule. If ``FixedAmount'' type is selected as the outdoor air control strategy, the outdoor air flow rate will be fixed at the value of this field and the ventilated slab will automatically set the maximum and minimum outside flow rate to be equal by ignoring the maximum outdoor air flow rate.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Outdoor Air Schedule Name 
MinimumOutdoorAirScheduleName
```
This field contains a schedule name (ref: Schedule) that should contain values for the minimum outdoor air used by the ventilated slab system for IAQ or other reasons.~ Note that if the ventilated slab is scheduled off or if there is no load sensed in the zone that the system will not operate even to achieve the minimum air fraction.~ However, if the system is operating, it will always bring in at least this fraction of the minimum air flow rate (see minimum air flow rate field above). If ``FixedAmount'' type is selected as the outdoor air control strategy, the actual outdoor air flow rate will be this number multiplied by the minimum outdoor air flow rate in the field above. The ventilated slab will automatically set the maximum and minimum outdoor air schedule to be equal by ignoring the maximum outdoor air schedule.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Outdoor Air Flow Rate 
MaximumOutdoorAirFlowRate
```
This field allows the user to enter the maximum volumetric flow rate of outdoor air that can be brought into the ventilated slab in m^{3}/sec.~ This parameter should be some real number greater than zero.~ Note that the value for this parameter may be less than the maximum air flow rate of the ventilated slab and this may affect the maximum fraction of outdoor air within the control strategy defined above. This parameter is an absolute maximum and will supercede any scheduled fraction of the ventilated slab maximum airflow rate. If ``FixedAmount'' type is selected as the outdoor air control strategy, this field will be ignored and be automatically set to be equal to the minimum outdoor air flow rate specified in the field above.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Outdoor Air Fraction or Temperature Schedule Name 
MaximumOutdoorAirFractionOrTemperatureScheduleName
```
This field can have one of two meanings depending the type of control selected in the outdoor air control type parameter above.~ If ``VariablePercent'' or ``FixedAmount'' was selected, then this field is a schedule name (ref: Schedule) corresponding to a maximum air fraction schedule. Furthermore, if ``FixedAmount'' type is selected as the outdoor air control strategy, this field will be ignored and be automatically set to be equal to the minimum outdoor air fraction specified in the field below. Note that this is a fraction of the maximum airflow rate field (see parameter above) for the ventilated slab. If ``FixedTemperature'' control was selected, then this field is still a schedule name (ref: Schedule), but it corresponds to a schedule of mixed air temperatures that the outdoor air control will try to attain.
```
	
##  Field: System Configuration Type 
SystemConfigurationType
```
This field allows the user to control how the air is circulated using the ventilated slab system.~ The options for system configuration are
  SlabOnly
  SlabAndZone
  SeriesSlabs
In the {SlabOnly}, the ventilation air is sent to the slab only and does not enter the zone.~ In the {SlabAndZone}, the air first enters the slab and then is delivered to the zone before returning to the system. With the {SeriesSlabs} option, the user specifies a list of slabs ({ZoneHVAC:VentilatedSlab:SlabGroup}). This list determines the order of slabs through which the air passes.~ In this option, air is not delivered to any zone.
```
	
##  Field: Hollow Core Inside Diameter 
HollowCoreInsideDiameter
```
This field is the inside diameter of the cores through which air is circulated for the system being defined by this statement.~ The inside diameter should be recorded in meters and is used to determine the convective heat transfer from the circulated air to the inside surface of the ventilated slab.
```
	
##  Field: Hollow Core Length 
HollowCoreLength
```
This field is the length of core embedded in the surface named above in the surface name field.~ In other words, this should be the distance that air travels as it through the slab.~ The length of the hollow core in the slab should be entered in meters and is used to determine the effectiveness of heat transfer from the air being circulated through the cores and the core inside surface.~ Longer core lengths result in more heat transferred to/from the radiant surface to the circulating fluid.
```
	
##  Field: Number of Cores 
NumberOfCores
```
This field allows the user to specify how many cores there are in the ventilated slab.~ Air flow will be divided equally among the different cores.
```
	
##  Field: Temperature Control Type 
TemperatureControlType
```
This field specifies along with the throttling range and setpoint schedules how the user wishes to control the ventilated slab system.~ The temperature denoted in the set temperature schedule can refer to one of seven different temperatures: the zone mean air temperature, the zone mean radiant temperature, the zone operative temperature, the surface temperature of the ventilated slab, the outdoor dry-bulb temperature, the outdoor wet-bulb temperature, or the dewpoint temperature of zone mean air temperature.~ The choice of temperature is controlled by the current field---temperature control type.~ The user must select from the following options:
  MeanAirTemperature
  MeanRadiantTemperature
  OperativeTemperature
  OutdoorDryBulbTemperature
  OutdoorWetBulbTemperature
  SurfaceTemperature
  ZoneAirDewPointTemperature
If the user does not select a control type, {MeanAirTemperature} control is assumed by EnergyPlus. See the control temperature schedule fields below for more information.
```
	
##  Field: Heating High Air Temperature Schedule Name 
HeatingHighAirTemperatureScheduleName
```
This field specifies the high air temperature in degrees Celsius for the temperature control of a ventilated slab system. Air and control temperatures for heating work together to provide a linear function that determines the air temperature sent to the ventilated slab. The current control temperature (see Temperature Control Type above) is compared to the high and low control temperatures at the current time.~~~~~ If the control temperature is above the high temperature, then the inlet air temperature is set to the low air temperature. If the control temperature is below the low temperature, then the inlet air temperature is set to the high air temperature. If the control temperature is between the high and low value, then the inlet air temperature is linearly interpolated between the low and high air temperature values.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Low Air Temperature Schedule Name 
HeatingLowAirTemperatureScheduleName

##  Field: Cooling High Air Temperature Schedule Name 
CoolingHighAirTemperatureScheduleName
```
This field specifies the high air temperature in degrees Celsius for the temperature control of a ventilated slab system. Air and control temperatures for cooling work together to provide a linear function that determines the air temperature sent to the ventilated slab system. The current control temperature (see Temperature Control Type above) is compared to the high and low control temperatures at the current time. If the control temperature is above the high temperature, then the inlet air temperature is set to the low air temperature. If the control temperature is below the low temperature, then the inlet air temperature is set to the high air temperature. If the control temperature is between the high and low value, then the inlet air temperature is linearly interpolated between the low and high air temperature values.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Low Air Temperature Schedule Name

# SetpointManagerScheduled

`SetpointManager:Scheduled`
```
The simplest Setpoint Manager simply uses a schedule to determine one or more setpoints. No node data is used as input. The input consists of the Setpoint Manager name, the control variable, the schedule name, and the name of a node list. The node list contains the name of those nodes at which the setpoint is to be applied. Of course, a node list name can always be simply the name of a single node.
Note that although this object provides a very general method of setting the values of many different control variables on nodes, the component models and system solvers may or may not be able to use them. Therefore, it is important to understand that simply setting a control variable using this object will not necessarily always produce the desired behavior.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
A unique, user-assigned name for an instance of a scheduled setpoint manager. Anywhere in the input that this setpoint manager is used, it is referred to by this name.
```
	
##  Field: Control Variable 
ControlVariable
```
The type of variable that will be controlled. There are several choices for this type of set point manager. The most common control variable is Temperature but other major choices include: HumidityRatio and MassFlowRate. The versatility of control variables available here (probably) exceeds what is actually available in the component and systems models. However, a large number of possible control variables are made available here for maximum flexibility and because some (but not all) component models will be able to use them. The complete list of key words and the units required in the associated schedules follow.
  Temperature Temperture of fluid at node ( °C)
  MaximumTemperature Maximum temperature of fluid at node ( °C)
  MinimumTemperature Minimum temperature of fluid at node ( °C)
  HumidityRatio Humidity ratio of fluid at node (kgWater/kgDryAir)
  MaximumHumidityRatio Maximum humidity ratio of fluid at node (kgWater/kgDryAir)
  MinimumHumidityRatio Minimum humidity ratio of fluid at node (kgWater/kgDryAir)
  MassFlowRate Mass flow rate of fluid at node (kg/s)
  MaximumMassFlowRate Maximum mass flow rate of fluid at node (kg/s)
  MinimumMassFlowRate Minimum mass flow rate of fluid at node (kg/s)
```
	
##  Field: Schedule Name 
ScheduleName
```
The name of a schedule whose values are to be used as setpoints on the node or node list. The schedule value for each time period is the setpoint for this type of setpoint manager. The schedule must have values that are in the appropriate units as defined in the previous field.

# SetpointManagerOutdoorAirReset

`SetpointManager:OutdoorAirReset`
```
The Outdoor Air Reset Setpoint Manager is used to place a setpoint temperature on a system node according to the outdoor air temperature using a reset rule. The reset rule is determined by 2 points: the setpoint temperature at the outdoor air high temperature (TSetAtOAHigh) and the setpoint temperature at the outdoor air low temperature (TSetAtOALow). If the outdoor air temperature is above the outdoor air high temperature limit, the setpoint temperature is set to TSetAtOAHigh. If the outdoor air temperature is below the outdoor air low temperature limit, the setpoint temperature is set to TSetAtOALow. If the outdoor air temperature is between the outdoor air high and outdoor air low temperatures limits, the setpoint temperature is linearly interpolated between TSetAtOAHigh and TSetAtOALow. The outdoor air temperature is obtained from the weather information during the simulation. This setpoint manager can be used to place a setpoint temperature on air loop and plant loop system nodes.
The input consists of the setpoint manager name, the type of control variable, a node list name of the nodes affected by the setpoint, and the data for the reset rule: the setpoint temperature at the outdoor air low temperature, the outdoor air low temperature limit, the setpoint temperature at the outdoor air high temperature, and the outdoor air high temperature limit.
There are optional inputs for a second reset rule. First there is the name of a schedule that indicates which rule to use: a schedule value of 1 means use the first rule; a schedule value of 2 means use the second rule. Next, there are the 4 inputs specifying the second reset rule.

# SetpointManagerSingleZoneHumidityMinimum

`SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Minimum`
```
The Single Zone Minimum Humidity Setpoint Manager allows the control of a single zone minimum humidity level. This setpoint manager detects the humidity level in a control zone and, using air and moisture mass balance, calculates the supply air humidity ratio needed to maintain the zone relative humidity at or above a given setpoint. The calculated supply air humidity ratio is then used as the setpoint for the designated setpoint node. A humidifier component placed upstream of the setpoint node can then use the humidity ratio setpoint to control its moisture addition rate.
The use of this object requires that a {ZoneControl:Humidistat} object be specified with a humidifying relative humidity schedule for the controlling zone. The humidistat's controlling zone must correspond with the control zone air node name specified in this setpoint manager.
```

# SetpointManagerSingleZoneHumidityMaximum

`SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum`
```
The Single Zone Maximum Humidity Setpoint Manager allows the control of a single zone maximum humidity level. This setpoint manager, used in conjunction with object {ZoneControl:Humidistat}, detects the air humidity level in a single control zone and uses air/moisture mass balances to calculate the supply air humidity ratio needed to maintain the zone relative humidity at or below a given setpoint. The calculated supply air humidity ratio is then used as the setpoint for the designated setpoint node. A dehumidification component placed upstream of this node can then use the humidity ratio setpoint to control its moisture removal rate (e.g., desiccant dehumidifiers).
In the case of a chilled water coil which is used for both temperature and high humidity control, this setpoint manager works in conjunction with a {Controller:WaterCoil} object to determine the minimum supply air temperature required to meet both the temperature (sensible) and humidity (latent) load in the control zone. See object {Controller:WaterCoil} in the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference for a detailed discussion of how this is achieved.
The use of this object requires that a {ZoneControl:Humidistat} object be specified with a relative humidity setpoint schedule for the controlling zone. The humidistat's controlling zone must correspond with the control zone air node name specified in this setpoint manager..

# SetpointManagerMixedAir

`SetpointManager:MixedAir`
```
The Mixed Air Setpoint Manager is meant to be used in conjunction with a {Controller:OutdoorAir} object. This setpoint manager is used to establish a temperature setpoint at the mixed air node. The {Controller:OutdoorAir} then operates the outdoor air damper to attempt to meet this setpoint.
In EnergyPlus the relief and outdoor air dampers, the economizer, and any outdoor air conditioning equipment form a separate subsystem of an air loop system (ref. {AirLoopHVAC}). The outdoor air controller operates within the subsystem. Consequently the mixed air temperature setpoint must take into account any downstream system fan heat if it is to meet a desired system supply air leaving temperature. The Mixed Air Setpoint Manager accomplishes this by referencing a supply air setpoint set by another setpoint manager (most likely at the {AirLoopHVAC} outlet node). The supply fan inlet and outlet nodes are also inputs to the Mixed Air Setpoint Manager. From this information the Mixed Air Setpoint Manager calculates the supply fan air temperature rise, subtracts it from the reference setpoint temperature, and sets the result as the mixed air node setpoint temperature.
Of course any type of setpoint manager can be used to establish a temperature setpoint at the mixed air node. But the Mixed Air Setpoint Manager is likely to be the most useful.
When optional inputs of Cooling Coil Inlet Node Name, Cooling coil Outlet Node Name, and Minimum Temperature at Cooling Coil Outlet Node are provided, the setpoint temperature at the mixed air node is calculated based on the maximum of both the reference setpoint temperature and minimum cooling coil outlet temperature, minus the cooling coil air temperature reduction and the supply fan air temperature rise if the supply fan placement is blow through. The setpoint temperature at the mixed air node is used to calculate the maximum outdoor air flow fraction in the corresponding {Controller:OutdoorAir} object. The outdoor air flow fraction is capped at the maximum outdoor air flow fraction to prevent the cooling coil from freezing, even though the fraction is below the minimum outdoor air flow fraction.

# SetpointManagerOutdoorAirPretreat

`SetpointManager:OutdoorAirPretreat`
```
The OutdoorAir Pretreat Setpoint Manager is meant to be used in conjunction with an {OutdoorAir:Mixer} object. The Outdoor air Pretreat Setpoint Manager is used to establish a temperature or humidity ratio setpoint in the outdoor air stream flowing into the ``Outdoor Air Stream Node'' of an {OutdoorAir:Mixer} object. This setpoint manager determines the required setpoint in the outdoor air stream to produce the reference setpoint in the mixed air stream after mixing with return air. For example, if the temperature setpoint at the mixed air node is 15 °C, the return air temperature is 20 °C, and the outdoor air flow fraction is 0.5, the Outdoor Air Pretreat setpoint would be set to 10 °C.
Of course any type of setpoint manager can be used to establish setpoints in the outdoor air stream, but this setpoint manager is likely to be the most useful for systems which precondition outdoor air with equipment such as a DX cooling coil or desiccant dehumidifier.

# SetpointManagerWarmest

`SetpointManager:Warmest`
```
The Warmest Setpoint Manager resets the cooling supply air temperature of a central forced air HVAC system according to the cooling demand of the warmest zone. For each zone in the system at each system timestep, the manager calculates a supply air temperature that will meet the zone cooling load at the maximum zone supply air flow rate. The lowest of the possible supply air temperatures becomes the new supply air temperature setpoint, subject to minimum and maximum supply air temperature constraints. The resulting temperature setpoint is the highest supply air temperature that will meet the cooling requirements of all the zones. When compared to a fixed cooling supply air temperature setpoint, this strategy minimizes zone reheat coil energy (or overcooling) and central chiller energy consumption (if the chilled water temperature is also reset) at the cost of possible increased fan energy.

# SetpointManagerColdest

`SetpointManager:Coldest`
```
The Coldest Setpoint Manager is used in dual duct systems to reset the setpoint temperature of the air in the heating supply duct or in single duct systems to reset the setpoint temperature of the air for central heating coils. Usually it is used in conjunction with a {SetpointManager:Warmest} resetting the temperature of the air in the cooling supply duct. For each zone in the system at each system timestep, the manager calculates a supply air temperature that will meet the zone heating load at the maximum zone supply air flow rate. The highest of the possible supply air temperatures becomes the new supply air temperature setpoint, subject to minimum and maximum supply air temperature constraints. The resulting temperature setpoint is the lowest supply air temperature that will meet the heating requirements of all the zones. When compared to a fixed heating supply air temperature setpoint, this strategy minimizes central boiler energy consumption (if the hot water temperature is also reset or there are variable speed pumps) at the cost of possible increased fan energy (if there is variable volume control in the air system).

# SetpointManagerReturnAirBypassFlow

`SetpointManager:ReturnAirBypassFlow`
```
This manager is user in conjunction with a return air bypass configuration. This type of air system is basically a standard single duct system with the addition of a bypass duct that bypasses return air around the main system components in particular, the central cooling coil. This allows the central cooling coil to sufficiently dehumidify the mixed air; the bypassed air is then added to the supply air stream to bring the supply air temperature up to the desired temperature set point. This scheme is very useful in situations where an higher than normal supply air temperature is used for instance, in underfloor air distribution systems.
This manager relies on the program to figure out the system configuration and to extract the needed data from the system nodes. All the user needs to input is the name of the air system and a schedule giving the desired supply air temperature setpoint. No node names are required. The manager will establish a bypass air flow rate that upon mixing with the non-bypassed air will yield the temperature given in the schedule.

# SetpointManagerWarmestTemperatureFlow

`SetpointManager:WarmestTemperatureFlow`
```
The Warmest Temperature Flow Setpoint Manager resets the cooling supply air temperature of a central forced air HVAC system according to the cooling demand of the warmest zone. The user can select one of two strategies: {TemperatureFirst} or {FlowFirst}.
For {TemperatureFirst} the manager tries to find the highest setpoint temperature that will satisfy all the zone cooling loads at minimum supply air flow rate. If this setpoint temperature is less than the minimum, the setpoint temperature is set to the minimum, and the supply air flow rate is increased to meet the loads.
For {FlowFirst} the manager tries to find the lowest supply air flow rate that will satisfy all the zone cooling loads at the maximum setpoint temperature. If this flow is greater than the maximum, the flow is set to the maximum and the setpoint temperature is reduced to satisfy the cooling loads.
When compared to a fixed cooling supply air temperature setpoint, the {TemperatureFirst} strategy minimizes fan energy at the cost of possible increased zone reheat coil energy (or overcooling) and central chiller energy consumption, whereas the {FlowFirst} strategy minimizes zone reheat coil energy (or overcooling) and central chiller energy consumption at the cost of possible increased fan energy.

# SetpointManagerMultiZoneCoolingAverage

`SetpointManager:MultiZone:Cooling:Average`
```
This setpoint manager is used to establish a supply air temperature setpoint for a central forced air HVAC system (air loop) based on the predicted sensible cooling loads and actual supply air mass flow rates for all zones served by the system. For all controlled zones in the air loop (i.e., zones with a thermostat object), the setpoint manager calculates an average supply air temperature that will meet the zone cooling loads based on the actual zone supply air mass flow rates (lagged by one time step). The calculated setpoint temperature is subject to the minimum and maximum setpoint temperature constraints specified by the user. When compared to a fixed cooling supply air temperature setpoint, this strategy may reduce zone reheat coil energy (or overcooling) and central chiller energy consumption (if the chilled water temperature is also reset) at the cost of possible increased fan energy.

# SetpointManagerMultiZoneMinimumHumidityAverage

`SetpointManager:MultiZone:MinimumHumidity:Average`
```
This setpoint manager allows for controlling the minimum humidity level is multiple zones served by a central forced air HVAC system (air loop). This setpoint manager, used in conjunction with one or more {ZoneControl:Humidistat} objects, detects the air humidity level in multiple controlled zones served by the HVAC air loop and uses air/moisture mass balances to calculate an average supply air humidity ratio needed to maintain the zone relative humidity levels near their respective humidifying setpoints. The calculated humidity ratio is then used as the minimum humidity ratio setpoint for the designated setpoint node(s). A humidification component (e.g., {Humidifier:Steam:Electric}) placed upstream of the setpoint node can then use the minimum humidity ratio setpoint to control humidification rate. The use of this object requires that a {ZoneControl:Humidistat} object be specified with a humidifying relative humidity schedule for one or more controlled zones served by the HVAC air loop.

##  Field: Minimum Lift 
MinimumLift
```
This field establishes the minimum Lift allowed. Lift is generally thought of as the difference between condenser refrigerant pressure and the evaporator refrigerant pressure. Using defined pressure and temperature relationships, lift also can be related to the difference between the leaving chilled water and the leaving condenser water temperature. Further, when the leaving condenser water temperature and condenser water flow are constant, the entering condenser temperature can be used as a proxy for lift. Because most condenser water systems are designed for constant flow, entering condenser temperature is the most common metric for lift, and that is what meant here. If the calculated Condenser Entering Water Setpoint falls below (TEvapLvgWater+ MinimumLift), then the Condenser Entering Water Setpoint is reset to equal TEvapLvgWater+ MinimumLift. The units for this field are deg C TD. Default is 11.1 °C (20 F).
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Condenser Entering Temperature

This field establishes the minimum lift allowed. Lift is generally thought of as the difference between condenser refrigerant pressure and the evaporator refrigerant pressure. Using defined pressure and temperature relationships, lift also can be related to the difference between the leaving chilled water and the leaving condenser water temperature. Further, when the leaving condenser water temperature and condenser water flow are constant, the entering condenser temperature can be used as a proxy for lift. Because most condenser water systems are designed for constant flow, entering condenser temperature is the most common metric for lift, and that is what meant here. If the optimized condenser entering water setpoint falls below leaving evaporator water temperature plus minimum lift, then the condenser entering water setpoint is reset to equal this field value plus leaving evaporator water temperature. This determines the minimum boundary of condenser entering water setpoint. The unit for this field is deg C TD. Default is 11.1 deg C (20 deg F).
```

# SetpointManagerSingleZoneOneStageCooling

`SetpointManager:SingleZone:OneStageCooling`
```
The singe-zone, one-stage cooling setpoint manager allows a component to be controlled based on thermostatic control using the object {ZoneControl:Thermostat:StagedDualSetpoint}. This setpoint manager differs from other parts of EnergyPlus that control based on predicted loads to setpoint. This setpoint manager allows modeling on/off cycling of DX coils using {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX} in continuous fan air handlers. This setpoint manger detects if the zone is calling for a cooling stage and applies one setpoint value if cooling is called for and another setpoint value if cooling is not called for.
This method of control is much more like real world thermostatic control but it requires short zone timesteps. Models using this type of control should use 60 timesteps per hour and will run much slower because of that.

# SetpointManagerSingleZoneOneStageHeating

# SetpointManagerReturnTemperatureChilledWater

`SetpointManager:ReturnTemperature:ChilledWater`
```
This setpoint manager allows for the central plant simulation in EnergyPlus to target a specific return water temperature entering the plant supply equipment. This setpoint manager is specifically for ``chilled water'' (although it could be any fluid) applications. This setpoint manager senses the current supply and return temperatures, calculates the current demand on the loop, and assuming this load remains constant for this time step, it predicts what set-point temperature would provide the desired target return temperature.
Because this is predictive, and the setpoint is only updated once per system timestep (frequency of the call to ManageSetPoints), the longer the time step, the less accurate the prediction will be. To make tighter control, the time step can be reduced down even to one minute. However, as described in the EngineeringReference, for most realistic building profiles the control works quite well under normal timestep size. If your load profile is highly jagged with step changes in demand, a smaller timestep could help achieve tight control.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field is a unique, user-assigned name for an instance of a chilled water return temperature reset setpoint manager.
```
	
##  Plant Loop Supply Outlet Node 
PlantLoopSupplyOutletNode
```
This alpha field is the name of the plant loop supply side outlet node for the plant being managed by this setpoint manager. The current temperature of this node is sensed in order to calculate current loop demand. This node is typically also where the plant loop setpoint is specified, but not necessarily. This setpoint manager looks up the actual setpoint node from the {PlantLoop} internal data structures as it is specified on the {PlantLoop} object. If the plant loop setpoint is on a different node than the supply outlet node, the loop may not maintain return temperature control as expected.
```
	
##  Plant Loop Supply Inlet Node 
PlantLoopSupplyInletNode
```
This alpha field is the name of the plant loop supply side inlet node whose temperature is controlled using this setpoint manager by resetting the supply setpoint temperature. The current temperature of this node is also sensed in order to calculate current loop demand.
```
	
##  Minimum Supply Temperature Setpoint 
MinimumSupplyTemperatureSetpoint
```
This numeric field plays multiple roles. During initialization, such as before the plant data structures are fully established, this is used as the default plant supply setpoint temperature. During normal calculation, this is used as the minimum chilled water supply temperature to avoid resetting the setpoint too low. During times of no-load, or odd conditions such as a negative load, the setpoint is reset to this design setpoint.
```
	
##  Maximum Supply Temperature Setpoint 
MaximumSupplyTemperatureSetpoint
```
This numeric field is the maximum value to which the supply setpoint can be reset. This ensures that the chilled water temperature does not go too high during reset operations.
```
	
##  Return Temperature Setpoint Input Type 
ReturnTemperatureSetpointInputType
```
This alpha field must be one of three strings: ``Constant'', ``Scheduled'', or ``ReturnTemperatureSetpoint''. If the choice is ``Constant'', the constant value in the next field is used as the target return temperature. If the choice is ``Scheduled'', the current value of the schedule named in the following field is used as the target return temperature. If the choice is ``ReturnTemperatureSetpoint'', the actual setpoint temperature on the ``Plant Loop Supply Inlet Node'' specified above is retrieved and used as the target return temperature. This is convenient as a separate setpoint manager could be established to pre-calculate the desired return temperature, and will assign the Setpoint internally. Then when this return temperature manager executes, the setpoint will be updated and utilized.
```
	
##  Return Temperature Setpoint Constant Value 
ReturnTemperatureSetpointConstantValue
```
If the ``Return Temperature Setpoint Input Type'' field is ``constant'', the numeric value entered here is used as the target return temperature throughout the simulation.
```
	
##  Return Temperature Setpoint Schedule Name 
ReturnTemperatureSetpointScheduleName
```
If the ``Return Temperature Setpoint Input Type'' field is ``scheduled'', this alpha field defines the name of a user-defined schedule storing values of return target temperature. The ``current'' value is looked up throughout the simulation. This is especially useful as EMS can be employed to do additional sensing and override the schedule value in a given timestep to a new dynamically-calculated return temperature.
An example idf input for a constant return reset setpoint manager is shown here:

This setpoint manager is specifically for ``hot water'' (although it could be any fluid) applications. This setpoint manager senses the current supply and return temperatures, calculates the current demand on the loop, and assuming this load remains constant for this time step, it predicts what supply set-point temperature would provide the desired target return temperature.

During times of no-load, or odd conditions such as a negative load, the setpoint is reset to this design setpoint.
```
	
##  Return Temperature Setpoint Input Type 
ReturnTemperatureSetpointInputType
```
This alpha field must be one of three strings: ``Constant'', ``Scheduled'', or ``ReturnTemperatureSetpoint''. If the choice is ``Constant'', the constant value in the next field is used as the target return temperature. If the choice is ``Scheduled'', the current value of the schedule named in the following field is used as the target return temperature. If the choice is ``ReturnTemperatureSetpoint'', the actual setpoint temperature on the ``Plant Loop Supply Inlet Node'' specified above is retrieved and used as the target return temperature. This is convenient as a separate setpoint manager could be established to pre-calculate the desired return temperature, and will assign the Setpoint internally. Then when this return temperature manager executes, the setpoint will be updated and utilized.
```
	
##  Return Temperature Setpoint Constant Value 
ReturnTemperatureSetpointConstantValue
```
If the ``Return Temperature Setpoint Input Type'' field is ``constant'', the numeric value entered here is used as the target return temperature throughout the simulation.
```
	
##  Return Temperature Setpoint Schedule Name 
ReturnTemperatureSetpointScheduleName
```
If the ``Return Temperature Setpoint Input Type'' field is ``scheduled'', this alpha field defines the name of a user-defined schedule storing values of return target temperature. The ``current'' value is looked up throughout the simulation. This is especially useful as EMS can be employed to do additional sensing and override the schedule value in a given timestep to a new dynamically-calculated return temperature.
An example idf input for a scheduled return reset setpoint manager is shown here:

# FurnaceAndUnitarySystems

`Furnace and Unitary Systems`
```
The components
  {AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem}
  {AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatOnly}
  {AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool}
  {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatOnly}
  {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool}
  {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir}
  {AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed}
are compound components usually placed in the primary air loop as the sole component. On the zone equipment side they are usually connected to one or more zones through uncontrolled terminal units (i.e., {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:NoReheat} objects). The maximum or design air flow rate through the furnace or unitary system should usually be set equal to the sum of the maximum air flow rates through the terminal unit objects. However, the simulation program can usually account for unequal air flows if the user wishes to model this scenario.
The following HVAC equipment types are allowed in the air loop. The component matrix shows which coils and fans are allowed with which equipment models.
```

# AirLoopHVACUnitarySystem

`AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem`
```
The AirloopHVAC:UnitarySystem object is intended to replace all other air loop equipment, although other system types are still available. This system is unique in that it can accommodate all fan and coil types whereas other system types are specific to the type of fan and coil available for simulation. Additionally, although the AirloopHVAC:UnitarySystem is intended for use in the primary airloop, this object can be modeled as zone equipment (i.e., listed in a {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList}) or as an outside air system component (i.e., listed in a {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList}). Water coil controllers are not required when these coil types are used with the AirloopHVAC:UnitarySystem object (i.e., leave the controller list name blank in the {AirLoopHVAC} object if water coils are used exclusively within the Unitary System).
The AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem object is a ``virtual'' component that consists of a fan component (OnOff, ConstantVolume, VariableVolume, or ComponentModel), a cooling coil component, a heating coil component, and a reheat coil as shown in Figure{fig:schematic-of-the-energyplus-unitary-system}. When a draw through configuration is desired, the fan is placed directly after the heating coil. If dehumidification control is selected, a reheat coil component is also required. If the reheat coil is present and the dehumidification control type input is not specified as CoolReheat, the reheat coil will not be active. All of the fan and coil components are optional which allows the AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem object to be configured for fan-only, heating-only, cooling-only, or both heating and cooling. It may also be applied without a fan, controlling one or more coils, similar to the function of {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX}.
Links to the fan, cooling coil, heating coil and reheat coil specifications are provided in the unitary system input data syntax. In addition, the control zone name and the system design operating conditions are specified by the unitary system inputs.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the unitary system.
```
	
##  Field: Control Type 
ControlType
```
This alpha field contains control type i.e.~load based or setpoint based for the unitary system. Valid choices are {Load}, {SetPoint} and {SingleZoneVAV}. Load and SingleZoneVAV control requires a Controlling Zone name. SetPoint control requires set points at each coil outlet node. A single set point at the outlet of the system is allowed but not recommended. If setpoint control is used and the system represents a heat pump (i.e., cooling and heating coils are both DX coils) then only one of these coils may operate at a time. SingleZoneVAV requires two distinct fan flow rates, namely the Cooling and Heating Supply Air Flow Rate and a lower No Load Supply Air Flow Rate which is used during times of reduced cooling or heating loads. SingleZoneVAV allows load control at low speed fan until the load exceeds available capacity or the outlet air temperature exceeds the specified limits where the fan speed is then increased. For the SingleZoneVAV control type, temperature limits are identified in the input fields for Minimum and Maximum Supply Air Temperature. Additionally, specific coil types are required for the SingleZoneVAV control type. The cooling coil types are {Coil:Cooling:Water}, {Coil:Cooling:Water:DetailedGeometry} and {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed} while the heating coil types are {Coil:Heating:Water}, {Coil:Heating:Fuel}, {Coil:Heating:Electric} and {Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed}. If alternate coil types are used they are modeled using the load based control method.
```
	
##  Field: Controlling Zone or Thermostat Location 
ControllingZoneOrThermostatLocation
```
This alpha field contains the identifying zone name where the thermostat controlling the unitary system is located. This field is required when Load or SingleZoneVAV control type is selected.
```
	
##  Field: Dehumidification Control Type 
DehumidificationControlType
```
This alpha field contains the type of dehumidification control. The following options are valid for this field:
{None} - meet sensible load only, no active dehumidification control. None is required when Control Type = SingleZoneVAV.
{Multimode} - activate enhanced dehumidification mode as needed and meet sensible load. This option is used to model DX equipment with a controllable heat exchanger assisting the DX cooling coil for improved dehumidification. It is valid only with cooling coil type = {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted}.
{CoolReheat} - cool beyond the dry-bulb temperature set point as required to meet the high humidity setpoint. If cooling coil type = {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted}, then the heat exchanger is assumed to always transfer energy between the cooling coil's inlet and outlet airstreams when the cooling coil is operating.
The default is {None}. For the other dehumidification control modes, the maximum humidity setpoint is used. This must be set using a {{ZoneControl:Humidistat}} object. When extra dehumidification is required, the system may not be able to meet the humidity setpoint if its full capacity is not adequate. If the dehumidification control type is specified as {CoolReheat}, then two additional inputs (reheat coil type and name) are also required as shown below. Although the reheat coil is required only when {CoolReheat} is selected, the optional reheat coil may be present for any of the allowed Dehumidification Control Types. If the reheat coil is present and the dehumidification control type is not specified as {CoolReheat}, the reheat coil will not be active,
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the schedule name which contains information on the availability of the unitary system to operate. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the unitary system must be off for that time period. A value greater than 0 denotes that the unitary system is available to operate during that time period. This schedule may be used to completely disable the unitary system as required. If this field is left blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Unitary System Air Inlet Node Name 
UnitarySystemAirInletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the unitary system air inlet node name.
When the UnitarySystem is used to serve a zone as a zone equipment unit, this node name must be either the name of a zone air exhaust node (Ref. {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}) to draw air from a zone directly or an induced air outlet node (Ref. {AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenum}) to draw air from a return plenum, when the zone return node is connected to a return plenum.
```
	
##  Field: Unitary System Air Outlet Node Name 
UnitarySystemAirOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the unitary system air outlet node name.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Fan Object Type 
SupplyFanObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the identifying type of supply air fan specified for the unitary system. Fan type must be {{Fan:OnOff},} {{Fan:ConstantVolume}, {Fan:VariableVolume}, or {Fan:ComponentModel}}. {Fan:ConstantVolume} is used when the Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule values are never 0 and the fan operates continuously. {Fan:OnOff} is used when the fan cycles on and off with the cooling or heating coil (i.e.~Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule values are at times 0). {Fan:VariableVolume} is used for variable air volume systems or multi- or variable-speed coils. The {Fan:ComponentModel} may be used in place of the ConstantVolume or VariableVolume fan types to more accurately represent fan performance.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Fan Name 
SupplyFanName
```
This alpha field contains the unique identifying name given to the unitary system fan.
```
	
##  Field: Fan Placement 
FanPlacement
```
This alpha field has two choices: {BlowThrough} or {DrawThrough}. The first choice stands for ``blow through fan''. This means that the unit consists of a fan followed by the main cooling and heating coils and supplemental heating coil. The fan ``blows through'' the cooling and heating coils. The second choice stands for ``draw through fan''. This means that the unit consists of the main cooling/heating coil(s) followed by a fan, with the supplemental heater located at the outlet of the fan. The fan ``draws air through'' the cooling/heating coil(s). If this field is left blank, the default is blow through.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name 
SupplyAirFanOperatingModeScheduleName
```
This alpha field specifies the name of the supply air fan operating mode schedule. The supply air fan operating mode may vary during the simulation based on time-of-day or with a change of season. Schedule values of 0 denote that the unitary system supply air fan and the heating or cooling coil cycle on and off together to meet the heating or cooling load (a.k.a. AUTO fan). Schedule values other than 0 denote that the supply fan runs continuously while the heating or cooling coil cycles to meet the load. The SingleZoneVAV control type is only active when the supply air fan runs continuously (i.e., during cycling fan operation the Control Type = Load model is used).
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Object Type 
HeatingCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the identifying type of heating coil specified in the unitary system. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connector objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop.

There are two choices Yes or No. If Yes, the DX coil is used as 100% outdoor DX coil. If No, the DX coil is used as regular DX coil. This input field is optional and the default is No. No should be specified when selecting the SingleZoneVAV control type.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Supply Air Temperature 
MinimumSupplyAirTemperature
```
When Use DOAS DX Cooling Coil is specified as Yes, this input field is the DX Cooling coils leaving minimum air temperature for frost control. The DX cooling coil leaving air temperature is not allowed to exceed this minimum air temperature. The DX cooling coil frost controller adjusts or limits the desired coil outlet air setpoint temperature when the coil outlet temperature exceeds this minimum temperature limit specified. The minimum and maximum values of this input field are 0.0°C and 7.5°C, and the default value is 2.0°C. This field is not autosizable when the input for Use DOAS DX Cooling Coil = Yes. When Control Type = SingleZoneVAV, enter the minimum air temperature limit for reduced fan speed in cooling mode. For SingleZoneVAV, the maximum limit for the minimum supply air temperature is 20.0°C. Additionally, for the SingleZoneVAV model this input does not limit the minimum supply air temperature resulting from cooling coil operation at high fan speed.

This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the unitary system in cubic meters per second when neither cooling or heating is required (i.e., main cooling/heating coils and supplemental heater are off but the supply air fan operates). This field is only used when the unitary system operating mode is specified as continuous fan operation or when the Control Type is specified as SingleZoneVAV. Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. If this field is autosized, then it is sized to the minimum of the heating and cooling lowest speed supply air flow rate. If the Control Type is specified as SingleZoneVAV and this field is autosized, then the no load supply air flow rate is set equal to 0.5 or 0.667 times the maximum flow rate for water or coils, respectively. If the unitary system operating mode is specified as continuous fan operation and this value is set to zero or this field is left blank, then the model assumes that the supply air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is equal to the supply air flow rate when the compressor was last operating (for cooling operation or heating operation). This field should not be set to 0 when Control Type is specified as SingleZoneVAV.

```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature Sensor Node Name 
OutdoorDryBulbTemperatureSensorNodeName
```
This alpha field specifies the name of the outdoor node which controls the operation of the supplemental heating coil. If this field is left blank, the outdoor temperature is based solely on the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be listed in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name must be specified in an {OutdoorAir:NodeList} object where the outdoor temperature is taken directly from the weather data.

##  Field: Design Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate 
DesignHeatRecoveryWaterFlowRate
```
This optional input field defines the design water flow rate used if the heat recovery option is being simulated. If this value is greater than 0.0 then a heat recovery loop must be specified and attached to the multispeed heat pump using the next 2 node fields. To determine how the heat recovery algorithm works, refer to the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference in the AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem with Heat Recovery section. The units for this input value are cubic meters per second.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Temperature for Heat Recovery 
MaximumTemperatureForHeatRecovery
```
This field sets the maximum temperature (in degrees C) that this heat pump can produce for heat recovery. The idea behind this field is that the current models do not take temperatures into account for availability and they just pass Q's around the loop without a temperature limit. This temperature limit puts an upper bound on the recovered heat and limits the max temperature leaving the component.
As temperatures in the loop approach the maximum temperature, the temperature difference between the entering water and the surfaces in the piece of equipment becomes smaller. For the given heat recovery flow rate and that temperature difference the amount of heat recovered will be reduced, and eventually there will be no heat recovered when the entering water temperature is equal to the maximum temperature specified by the user in this field. The reduced amount of heat recovered will diminish if the temperature of the loop approach is the maximum temperature, and this will show up in the reporting. This allows the user to set the availability or the quality of the heat recovered for usage in other parts of the system or to heat domestic hot water supply.

This field defines the number of heating speeds for the heat pump, and must match the number of heating speeds defined in the associated heating coil. The value for this input field defines the number of airflow rate ratios that must be defined for heating in the fields below. The minimum value for this field is one and the maximum value is the number specified in the coil object. If the heating coil type used in the unitary system object is not a multispeed coil type, then this field should be 1.
```
	
##  Field: Number of Speeds for Cooling 
NumberOfSpeedsForCooling
```
This field defines the number of cooling speeds for the heat pump, and must match the number of cooling speeds defined in the associated DX cooling coil. The value for this input field defines the number of airflow rate ratios that must be defined for cooling in the fields below. The minimum value for this field is one and the maximum value is the number specified in the coil object.

```
	
##  Field: Single Mode Operation 
SingleModeOperation
```
This field specifies the coil operation mode for multiple speed DX cooling and heating coils during each HVAC timestep. The allowed choice is Yes or No. The No choice allows a coil works between two adjacent speeds when a system load is greater than the coil capacity at speed 1. The Yes choice allows a coil works with a single capacity at a different speed. The speed number is determined by a system load.
The allowed cooling and heating coil types are restricted to the following combinations:

##  Field Group: Heating and Cooling Speeds 1 to 10 
GroupHeatingAndCoolingSpeeds1To10
```
The air flow through a multispeed coil system is specified as a group of two air flow ratio inputs, one each for heating and cooling. If the number of speeds for heating and cooling are different, inputs for both heating and cooling are still required for a given speed yet one input may be blank. The maximum of the inputs for Number of Speeds for Cooling and Number of Speeds for Heating specified above determines how many groups of heating and cooling supply air flow ratio inputs are required. Both inputs for Speed 1 are required and specify the air flow ratio for the lowest speed, followed by the inputs for Speed 2, Speed 3, etc. up to a maximum of 10 speeds. These inputs are applicable only to multispeed or variable speed coils.

# AirLoopHVACUnitaryFurnaceHeatCool

`AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool`
```
The heat/cool furnace is a ``virtual'' component that consists of a fan component (OnOff or ConstantVolume), a DX cooling coil component, and a Gas or Electric heating coil component. The blow through furnace configuration is shown in Figure{fig:schematic-of-energyplus-heatcool-furnace} below. When a draw through furnace configuration is desired, the fan is placed directly after the heating coil. If the dehumidification control type is specified as CoolReheat, a reheat coil component is also required. If the reheat coil is present and the dehumidification control type input is not specified as CoolReheat, the reheat coil will not be active,
Note: the coil order shown here has been revised from previous versions (prior to V4.0) of Energyplus to configure the cooling coil upstream of the heating coil. This configuration provides uniformity with all unitary equipment. However, for unitary HeatCool systems that do not use a reheat coil, the heating coil can also be placed upstream of the cooling coil. This optional coil placement is retained to allow compatibility with previous versions of Energyplus. For input files developed using previous versions of Energyplus, it is recommended that the coil order be revised according to the figure above.
Links to the fan, heating coil, DX cooling coil and optional reheat coil specifications are provided in the furnace input data syntax. In addition, the control zone name and the furnace design operating conditions are specified by the furnace inputs.

```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the schedule name which contains information on the availability of the furnace to operate. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the furnace must be off for that time period. A value greater than 0 denotes that the furnace is available to operate during that time period. This schedule may be used to completely disable the furnace as required. If this field is left blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.

SupplyAirFanOperatingModeScheduleName
```
This alpha field specifies the name of the supply air fan operating mode schedule. The supply air fan operating mode may vary during the simulation based on time-of-day or with a change of season. Schedule values of 0 denote that the furnace supply air fan and the heating or cooling coil cycle on and off together to meet the heating or cooling load (a.k.a. AUTO fan). Schedule values other than 0 denote that the supply fan runs continuously while the heating or cooling coil cycles to meet the load.
```

```
	
##  Field: No Load Supply Air Flow Rate 
NoLoadSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the furnace in cubic meters per second when neither cooling or heating is required (i.e., DX coils and supplemental heater are off but the supply air fan operates). This field is only used when the furnace operating mode is specified as continuous fan operation. Values must be greater than or equal to zero, or this field is autosizable. If the furnace operating mode is specified as continuous fan operation and this value is set to zero or this field is left blank, then the model assumes that the supply air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is equal to the supply air flow rate when the compressor was last operating (for cooling operation or heating operation).

```
	
##  Field: Supply Fan Object Type 
SupplyFanObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the identifying type of supply air fan specified for the furnace. Fan type must be {{Fan:OnOff}} or {{Fan:ConstantVolume}}. {Fan:ConstantVolume} is used when the Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule values are never 0 and the fan operates continuously. {Fan:OnOff} is used when the fan cycles on and off with the cooling or heating coil (i.e.~Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule values are at times 0).
```
	
##  Field: Supply Fan Name 
SupplyFanName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the furnace fan.
```
	
##  Field: Fan Placement 
FanPlacement
```
This alpha field has two choices: {BlowThrough} or {DrawThrough}. The first choice stands for ``blow through fan''. This means that the unit consists of a fan followed by the DX coils and supplemental heating coil. The fan ``blows through'' the cooling and heating coils. The second choice stands for ``draw through fan''. This means that the unit consists of the DX coil(s) followed by a fan, with the supplemental heater located at the outlet of the fan. The fan ``draws air through'' the DX coil(s). If this field is left blank, the default is blow through.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Object Type 
HeatingCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the identifying type of heating coil specified in the furnace. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connector objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the heating coil does not require additional controller or {Controller:WaterCoil} object. The parent object (Unitary Heat and Cool Furnace) itself provides the ``controller'' function of modulating water flow. Allowable coil types are:
  {Coil:Heating:Electric}
  {Coil:Heating:Fuel}
  {Coil:Heating:Water}
  {Coil:Heating:Steam}
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Name

```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the furnace cooling coil.
```
	
##  Field: Dehumidification Control Type 
DehumidificationControlType
```
This alpha field contains the type of dehumidification control. The following options are valid for this field:
  {None} - meet sensible load only, no active dehumidification control
  {Multimode} - activate enhanced dehumidification mode as needed and meet sensible load. This option is used to model DX equipment with a controllable heat exchanger assisting the DX cooling coil for improved dehumidification. It is valid only with cooling coil type = {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted}.
  {CoolReheat} - cool beyond the dry-bulb temperature set point as required to meet the high humidity setpoint. If cooling coil type = {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted}, then the heat exchanger is assumed to always transfer energy between the cooling coil's inlet and outlet airstreams when the cooling coil is operating.
The default is {None}. For the other dehumidification control modes, the maximum humidity setpoint is used. This must be set using a {{ZoneControl:Humidistat}} object. When extra dehumidification is required, the system may not be able to meet the humidity setpoint if its full capacity is not adequate. If the dehumidification control type is specified as {CoolReheat}, then two additional inputs (reheat coil type and name) are also required as shown below. Although the reheat coil is required only when {CoolRheat} is selected, the optional reheat coil may be present for any of the allowed Dehumidification Control Types. If the reheat coil is present and the dehumidification control type is not specified as {CoolReheat}, the reheat coil will not be active,
```
	
##  Field: Reheat Coil Object Type 
ReheatCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the identifying type of reheat coil specified in the furnace. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connector objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the reheat coil does not require additional controller or {Controller:WaterCoil} object. The parent object (Unitary Heat and Cool Furnace) itself provides the ``controller'' function of modulating water flow. Reheat coil type must be one of:
  {Coil:Heating:Electric}
  {Coil:Heating:Fuel}
  {Coil:Heating:Desuperheater}
  {Coil:Heating:Water}
  {Coil:Heating:Steam}
```
	
##  Field: Reheat Coil Name 
ReheatCoilName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the furnace reheat coil.
As shown in the example below, correct specification of the heat/cool furnace requires specification of the following objects in addition to the furnace object:
  fan ({Fan:OnOff} or {Fan:ConstantVolume})
  cooling coil ({Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed} or {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted})
  heating coil ({Coil:Heating:Fuel} or {Coil:Heating:Electric})
  reheat coil (optional, {Coil:Heating:Fuel}, {Coil:Heating:Electric}, or {Coil:Heating:Desuperheater})
  terminal unit ({AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:NoReheat}) for each zone served by the furnace
Note: the furnace's fan, cooling coil, heating coil and optional reheat coil must be connected in the air loop according to the configuration shown above (Figure{fig:schematic-of-energyplus-heatcool-furnace}) when CoolReheat is selected as the dehujmidificaiton control type. In addition, the volumetric air flow rate specified in the terminal air unit for the controlling zone should properly reflect the fractional volumetric air flow rate specified in the furnace object.

# AirLoopHVACUnitaryHeatCool

`AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool`
```
The AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool object is the identical model to the AirLoopHAVC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool object. The heat/cool unitary system is a ``virtual'' component that consists of a fan component (OnOff or ConstantVolume), a DX cooling coil component and a Gas or Electric heating coil component as shown in Figure{fig:schematic-of-blow-through-heatcool-unitary}. When a draw through configuration is desired, the fan is placed directly after the heating coil. If dehumidification control is selected, a reheat coil component is also required. If the reheat coil is present and the dehumidification control type input is not specified as CoolReheat, the reheat coil will not be active,
Note: the coil order shown here has been revised from previous versions (prior to V4.0) of Energyplus to configure the cooling coil upstream of the heating coil. This configuration provides uniformity with all unitary equipment. However, for unitary HeatCool systems that do not use a reheat coil, the heating coil can also be placed upstream of the cooling coil. This optional coil placement is retained to allow compatibility with previous versions of Energyplus. For input files developed using previous versions of Energyplus, it is recommended that the coil order be revised according to the figure above.
Links to the fan, DX cooling coil, heating coil and optional reheat coil specifications are provided in the unitary system input data syntax. In addition, the control zone name and the system design operating conditions are specified by the unitary system inputs.

# AirLoopHVACUnitaryHeatPumpAirToAir

`AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir`
```
The unitary air-to-air heat pump is a ``virtual'' component that consists of a fan component (OnOff or ConstantVolume), a DX cooling coil component, a DX heating coil component, and a Gas or Electric supplementary heating coil component as shown in the Figure below.
Links to the fan, DX cooling coil, DX heating coil, and supplementary heating coil specifications are provided in the heat pump's input data syntax. In addition the control zone name and the system design operating conditions are specified by the heat pump inputs.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the unitary system heat pump.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the schedule name (ref. Schedule objects) that contains information on the availability of the heat pump to operate. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during the hour. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for the hour. If this field is left blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the~ name of the HVAC system node from which the heat pump draws its inlet air.
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the~ name of the HVAC system node to which the heat pump sends its outlet air.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Supply Air Flow Rate 
CoolingSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX cooling coil is operating. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Supply Air Flow Rate 
HeatingSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX heating coil and/or supplemental heater are operating. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: No Load Supply Air Flow Rate 
NoLoadSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when neither cooling or heating is required (i.e., DX coils and supplemental heater are off but the supply air fan operates). This field is only used when the heat pump operating mode is specified as continuous fan operation. Values must be greater than or equal to zero, or this field is autosizable. If the heat pump operating mode is specified as continuous fan operation and this value is set to zero or this field is left blank, then the model assumes that the supply air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is equal to the supply air flow rate when the compressor was last operating (for cooling operation or heating operation).
```
	
##  Field: Controlling Zone or Thermostat Location 
ControllingZoneOrThermostatLocation
```
This alpha field contains the identifying zone name where the thermostat controlling the heat pump is located.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Object Type 
SupplyAirFanObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the identifying type of supply air fan specified for the heat pump. Fan type must be {{Fan:OnOff}} or {{Fan:ConstantVolume}}. {Fan:ConstantVolume} is used when the Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule values are never 0 and the fan operates continuously. {Fan:OnOff} is used when the fan cycles on and off with the cooling or heating coil (i.e.~Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule values are at times 0).
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Name 
SupplyAirFanName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the heat pump supply air fan, and should match the name specified in the corresponding fan object.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Object Type 
HeatingCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the identifying type of heating coil specified in the heat pump. Heating coil type must be either {Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed} or {Coil:Heating:DX:VariableSpeed}.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Name 
HeatingCoilName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the heat pump DX heating coil, and should match the name specified in the corresponding DX heating coil object.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Coil Object Type 
CoolingCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the identifying type of cooling coil specified in the heat pump. There are three valid choices for this field:
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed}
  {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed}
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Coil Name 
CoolingCoilName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the heat pump cooling coil, and should match the name specified in the corresponding DX cooling coil object.
```
	
##  Field: Supplemental Heating Coil Object Type 
SupplementalHeatingCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the identifying type of supplemental heating coil specified in the heat pump. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connector objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the supplemental heating coil does not require additional controller or {Controller:WaterCoil} object. The parent object (Airloop Air to Air Heat Pump) itself provides the ``controller'' function of modulating water flow. Heating coil type must be:
  {Coil:Heating:Electric}
  {Coil:Heating:Fuel}
  {Coil:Heating:Water}
  {Coil:Heating:Steam}
```
	
##  Field: Supplemental Heating Coil Name 
SupplementalHeatingCoilName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the heat pump supplemental heating coil, and should match the name specified in the corresponding heating coil object.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Supply Air Temperature from Supplemental Heater 
MaximumSupplyAirTemperatureFromSupplementalHeater
```
This numeric field defines the maximum allowed supply air temperature exiting the heat pump supplemental heating coil.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Supplemental Heater Operation 
MaximumOutdoorDryBulbTemperatureForSupplementalHeaterOperation
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which the heat pump supplemental heating coil is disabled. The temperature for this input field must be less than or equal to 21 C. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 21 C.
```
	
##  Field: Fan Placement 
FanPlacement
```
This alpha field has two choices: {BlowThrough} or {DrawThrough}. The first choice represents a blow through system where the supply air fan is before the DX cooling/heating coil and the supplementary heating coil. The second choice represents a draw through system where the supply air fan is between the DX cooling/heating coil and the supplementary heating coil. If this input field is left blank, the default is blow through.
{{Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name}}
This alpha field specifies the name of the supply air fan operating mode schedule. The supply air fan operating mode may vary during the simulation based on time-of-day or with a change of season. Schedule values of 0 denote that the unitary system supply air fan and the heating or cooling coil cycle on and off together to meet the heating or cooling load (a.k.a. AUTO fan). Schedule values other than 0 denote that the supply fan runs continuously while the heating or cooling coil cycles to meet the load.
As shown in the example below, correct specification of the air-to-air heat pump requires specification of the following objects in addition to the heat pump object:
1)~~~Fan ({Fan:OnOff} or {Fan:ConstantVolume})
2)~~~Heating coil ({Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed})
3)~~~Cooling coil ({Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed} or {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted})
4)~~~Supplemental heating coil ({Coil:Heating:Fuel} or {Coil:Heating:Electric})
5)~~~Direct air unit ({AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:NoReheat})for each zone served by the unitary system
```
	
##  Field: Dehumidification Control Type 
DehumidificationControlType
```
This alpha input field contains the type of dehumidification control. The following options are valid for this field:
  {None} - meet sensible load only, no active dehumidification control
  {Multimode} - activate enhanced dehumidification mode as needed and meet sensible cooling load. This option is used to model DX equipment with a controllable heat exchanger assisting the DX cooling coil for improved dehumidification. It is valid only with cooling coil type = {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted}.
  {CoolReheat} - cool beyond the dry-bulb temperature set point as required to meet the high humidity setpoint. The excess cooling beyond the cooling set point temperature is offset by the supplemental heating coil. If cooling coil type = {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted}, then the heat exchanger is assumed to always transfer energy between the cooling coil's inlet and outlet airstreams when the cooling coil is operating.
The default is {None}. For the other dehumidification control modes, the maximum humidity setpoint is required. This must be set using a {{ZoneControl:Humidistat}} object. When extra dehumidification is required, the system may not be able to meet the humidity setpoint if its full capacity is not adequate. Supplemental heating coil (supplemental heating coil type and name) is a required input in AirToAir HeatPumps. The supplemental heating coil capacity must be adequate enough to meet the heating coil load and offset the excess cooling load due to extra dehumidification required to meet the high relative humidity setpoint.
Note: the air-to-air heat pump's fan, cooling coil, heating coil and supplementary heating coil must be connected in the air loop according to the configuration shown above (Figure 118) for the blow-through fan configuration. The only other valid configuration is with a draw-through fan placement, where the fan is located between the DX heating coil and the supplementary heating coil.

# AirLoopHVACUnitaryHeatPumpAirToAirMultiSpeed

`AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed`
```
The multispeed air-to-air heat pump is a ``virtual'' component that consists of a fan component (On/Off or ConstVolume), a DX multispeed cooling coil component, a DX multispeed heating coil component, and a Gas or Electric supplemental heating coil component. This system also includes the option to use available waste energy to heat water. A schematic diagram of the air-to-air multispeed heat pump is shown below. The component connection sequence for the blow through option (shown below) from inlet to outlet is fan, cooling coil, heating coil, and supplemental heater. The connection sequence for the draw through option is cooling coil, heating coil, fan, and supplemental heater.
The main difference between this heat pump object and other EnergyPlus heat pump objects is that this object allows from two to four discrete compressor speeds for heating and cooling operation (instead of a single speed for each mode). The lowest speed is called Speed 1, and the highest speed is called Speed n (2, 3 or 4 as specified in the input syntax). This object allows a different number of speeds for cooling and heating, and each speed has an associated airflow rate. The airflow rates for the various heating speeds can be different from the airflow rates for the cooling speeds. In addition, the airflow rate when no cooling or heating is needed can also be defined. The number of cooling and heating speeds defined by the user in this heat pump object must equal the number of speeds defined in the associated coils (child objects). For example, the number of speeds for cooling defined in this heat pump object must be equal to the number of speeds defined in the associated cooling coil object.
Links to the fan, DX multispeed cooling coil, DX multispeed heating coil, and supplementary heating coil specifications are provided in the heat pump's input data syntax. In addition, the control zone name and airflow rates at the corresponding compressor speeds are specified by the heat pump syntax.
If the {ZoneControl:Thermostat:StagedDualSetpoint} object and other zone control thermostat and humidistat are assigned to the same controlled zone in the Controlling Zone or Thermostat Location field, the {ZoneControl:Thermostat:StagedDualSetpoint} object takes precedence and the stage number provided by the the {ZoneControl:Thermostat:StagedDualSetpoint} object is used to set the speed number.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the multispeed heat pump.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the schedule name (ref. Schedule objects) that contains information on the availability of the heat pump to operate. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for the time period. If this field is left blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the HVAC system node from which the heat pump draws its inlet air.
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the HVAC system node to which the heat pump sends its outlet air.
```
	
##  Field: Controlling Zone or Thermostat Location 
ControllingZoneOrThermostatLocation
```
This alpha field contains the identifying zone name where the thermostat controlling the multispeed heat pump is located.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Object Type 
SupplyAirFanObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the identifying type of supply air fan specified for the heat pump. Fan type must be {Fan:OnOff} or {Fan:ConstantVolume}. {Fan:ConstantVolume} can only be used when the supply air fan operating mode is continuous (see field `Supply air fan operating mode schedule name).
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Name 
SupplyAirFanName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the heat pump supply air fan, and should match the name specified in the corresponding fan object.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Placement 
SupplyAirFanPlacement
```
This alpha field has two choices: {BlowThrough} or {DrawThrough}. The first choice stands for ``blow through fan''. This means that the unit consists of a fan followed by a DX multispeed cooling coil, DX multispeed heating coil, and a supplemental heating coil. The fan ``blows through'' the cooling and heating coils. The second choice stands for ``draw through fan''. This means that the unit consists of the DX cooling and heating coils followed by a fan, with the supplemental heater located at the outlet of the fan.~ The fan ``draws'' air through the DX coils.
{Note}: the multispeed heat pump's supply air fan, cooling coil, heating coil and supplemental heating coil must be connected according to the configuration shown above (Figure{fig:schematic-of-energyplus-unitary-air-to-air}) for the `blow through' fan configuration. For the `draw through' fan configuration the fan must be located between the DX heating coil and the supplemental heater, whose outlet node is the system outlet node. In addition, the DX cooling coil and DX heating coil operation mode must be specified consistently with the heat pump's supply air fan operating mode (e.g., with the heat pump's supply air fan set to cycle on and off with the cooling/heating load, the DX cooling and heating coil operation mode must be CyclingFanAndCompressor). If the operation modes in the parent (heat pump) and child (coil) objects are specified differently, the operation mode in the parent object prevails.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name 
SupplyAirFanOperatingModeScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the schedule name (ref. Schedule objects) that contains information to control the supply air fan. Schedule values of zero mean that the supply air fan will cycle off if there is no cooling or heating load in the control zone. Non-zero schedule values mean that the supply air fan will operate continuously even if there is no cooling or heating load in the control zone. If this field is left blank, the supply air fan will operate continuously for the entire simulation period.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Object Type 
HeatingCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the identifying type of heating coil specified in the heat pump.~ Allowable choices for Heating coil type~ are {{Coil:Heating:DX:MultiSpeed}}, {{Coil:Heating:Electric:MultiStage}}, {{Coil:Heating:Gas:MultiStage}}, {{Coil:Heating:Water}}, and~ {{Coil:Heating:Steam}}.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Name 
HeatingCoilName

```
{Deprecated field}. The Minimum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Compressor Operation is now controlled by the {Coil:Cooling:DX:MultiSpeed} and {Coil:Heating:DX:MultiSpeed} (if used) coil objects.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Coil Object Type 
CoolingCoilObjectType
```

```
	
##  Field: Cooling Coil Name 
CoolingCoilName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the heat pump cooling coil, and should match the name specified in the corresponding DX cooling coil object.
```
	
##  Field: Supplemental Heating Coil Object Type 
SupplementalHeatingCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the identifying type of supplemental heating coil specified in the heat pump. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connectors objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the supplemental heating coil does not require additional controller or {Controller:WaterCoil} object. The parent object (Unitary MultiSpeed Air to Air Heat Pump) itself provides the ``controller'' function of modulating water flow. Heating coil type must be:
  {Coil:Heating:Electric}
  {Coil:Heating:Fuel}
  {Coil:Heating:Water}
  {Coil:Heating:Steam}
```
	
##  Field: Supplemental Heating Coil Name 
SupplementalHeatingCoilName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the heat pump supplemental heating coil, and should match the name specified in the corresponding heating coil object.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Supply Air Temperature from Supplemental Heater 
MaximumSupplyAirTemperatureFromSupplementalHeater
```
This numeric field defines the maximum allowed supply air temperature (in degrees C) exiting the heat pump supplemental heating coil. If the calculated supply air temperature exiting the supplemental heater exceeds this value, then it is reset to this maximum temperature. This field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Supplemental Heater Operation 
MaximumOutdoorDryBulbTemperatureForSupplementalHeaterOperation
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which the heat pump supplemental heating coil is disabled.~ The temperature for this input field must be less than or equal to 21 C. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 21 C.
```
	
##  Field: Auxiliary On-Cycle Electric Power 
AuxiliaryOnCycleElectricPower
```
This field defines auxiliary electrical power (W) consumed during the on-cycle period (i.e., when the cooling or heating coil is operating). The model assumes that this auxiliary power does not contribute to heating the supply air. The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if the field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Auxiliary Off-Cycle Electric Power 
AuxiliaryOffCycleElectricPower
```
This field defines auxiliary electrical power (W) consumed during the off-cycle period (i.e., when the cooling and heating coil are not operating). The model assumes that this auxiliary power does not contribute to heating the supply air. The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if the field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Design Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate 
DesignHeatRecoveryWaterFlowRate
```
This optional input field defines the design water flow rate used if the heat recovery option is being simulated. If this value is greater than 0.0 then a heat recovery loop must be specified and attached to the multispeed heat pump using the next 2 node fields. To determine how the heat recovery algorithm works, refer to the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference in the AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed with Heat Recovery section. The units for this input value are cubic meters per second.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Temperature for Heat Recovery 
MaximumTemperatureForHeatRecovery
```
This field sets the maximum temperature (in degrees C) that this heat pump can produce for heat recovery. The idea behind this field is that the current models do not take temperatures into account for availability and they just pass Q's around the loop without a temperature limit. This temperature limit puts an upper bound on the recovered heat and limits the max temperature leaving the component.
As temperatures in the loop approach the maximum temperature, the temperature difference between the entering water and the surfaces in the piece of equipment becomes smaller. For the given heat recovery flow rate and that temperature difference the amount of heat recovered will be reduced, and eventually there will be no heat recovered when the entering water temperature is equal to the maximum temperature specified by the user in this field. The reduced amount of heat recovered will diminish if the temperature of the loop approach is the maximum temperature, and this will show up in the reporting. This allows the user to set the availability or the quality of the heat recovered for usage in other parts of the system or to heat domestic hot water supply.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Recovery Water Inlet Node Name 
HeatRecoveryWaterInletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the heat recovery side inlet node.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Recovery Water Outlet Node Name 
HeatRecoveryWaterOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the heat recovery side outlet node.
```
	
##  Field: No Load Supply Air Flow Rate 
NoLoadSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when neither cooling nor heating is required (i.e., DX coils and supplemental heater are off but the supply air fan operates). This field is only used when the heat pump supply air fan is scheduled to operate continuously regardless of DX coil operation (ref. field ``Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule). Values must be greater than or equal to zero, or this field is autosizable. If the heat pump supply air fan is scheduled to operate continuously and the input value for this field is set to zero or this field is left blank, then the model assumes that the supply air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is equal to the supply air flow rate when the compressor was last operating (for cooling operation or heating operation).
```
	
##  Field: Number of Speeds for Heating 
NumberOfSpeedsForHeating
```
This field defines the number of heating speeds for the heat pump, and must match the number of heating speeds defined in the associated heating coil. The value for this input field defines the number of airflow rates that must be defined for heating in the field below. The minimum value for this field is one and the maximum value is four. If the Heating Coil Object Type above are {{Coil:Heating:Water}} or {{Coil:Heating:Steam}}, then this field should be 1.
```
	
##  Field: Number of Speeds for Cooling 
NumberOfSpeedsForCooling
```
This field defines the number of cooling speeds for the heat pump, and must match the number of cooling speeds defined in the associated DX cooling coil. The value for this input field defines the number of airflow rates that must be defined for cooling in the field below. The minimum value for this field is two and the maximum value is four.

```
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX heating coil and/or supplemental heater are operating at Speed 4 (high speed). Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable. If not autosized, the entered value must be greater or equal to the flow rate specified for heating Speed 3. If the `Number of Speeds for Heating' is less than 4, then this field can be left blank.
{Note}: When autosizable is selected for any of the supply air volumetric flow rate fields, all supply air flow fields at the different speeds must be specified as autosizable. Otherwise, a fatal error will be issued and the simulation will terminate.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Speed 1 Supply Air Flow Rate 
CoolingSpeed1SupplyAirFlowRate
```
This required numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX cooling coil is operating at Speed 1 (lowest speed). Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable.

# AirLoopHVACUnitaryFurnaceHeatOnly

`AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatOnly`
```
The EnergyPlus furnace is a ``virtual'' component that consists of a fan component~ (OnOff or ConstantVolume) and a Gas or Electric heating coil component. The blow through furnace configuration is shown in the Figure below.
Links to the fan and heating coil specifications are provided in the furnace input data syntax. In addition the control zone name and the furnace design operating conditions are specified by the furnace inputs.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the furnace.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the schedule name which contains information on the availability of the furnace to operate. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the furnace must be off for that time period. A value greater than 0 denotes that the furnace is available to operate during that time period. This schedule may be used to completely disable the unitary system as required. If this field is left blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Furnace Inlet Node Name 
FurnaceInletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the furnace inlet node name.
```
	
##  Field: Furnace Outlet Node Name 
FurnaceOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the furnace outlet node name.
{{Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name}}
This alpha field specifies the name of the supply air fan operating mode schedule. The supply air fan operating mode may vary during the simulation based on time-of-day or with a change of season. Schedule values of 0 denote that the furnace supply air fan and the heating coil cycle on and off together to meet the heating load (a.k.a. AUTO fan). Schedule values other than 0 denote that the supply fan runs continuously while the heating coil cycles to meet the load.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Supply Air Temperature 
MaximumSupplyAirTemperature
```
This numeric field contains the design operating furnace air outlet temperature in degrees C when the furnace is heating. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 80 C.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Supply Air Flow Rate 
HeatingSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the design volumetric flow rate of the furnace in cubic meters per second. This volumetric flow rate should match the flow rate specified for the furnace fan.
```
	
##  Field: Controlling Zone or Thermostat Location 
ControllingZoneOrThermostatLocation
```
This alpha field contains the identifying zone name where the thermostat controlling the furnace is located.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Fan Object Type 
SupplyFanObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the identifying type of supply air fan specified for the furnace. Fan type must be {{Fan:OnOff}} or {{Fan:ConstantVolume}}. {Fan:ConstantVolume} is used when the Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule values are never 0 and the fan operates continuously. {Fan:OnOff} is used when the fan cycles on and off with the cooling or heating coil (i.e.~Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule values are at times 0).
```
	
##  Field: Supply Fan Name 
SupplyFanName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the furnace fan.
```
	
##  Field: Fan Placement 
FanPlacement
```
This alpha field has two choices: {BlowThrough} or {DrawThrough}. The first choice stands for ``blow through fan''. This means that the unit consists of a fan followed by the heating coil. The fan ``blows through'' the heating coil. The second choice stands for ``draw through fan''. This means that the unit consists of the heating coil followed by a fan. The fan ``draws air through'' the heating coil. If this field is left blank, the default is blow through.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Object Type 
HeatingCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the identifying type of heating coil specified in the furnace. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connectors objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the heating coil does not require additional controller or {Controller:WaterCoil} object. The parent object (Unitary Heat Only Furnace) itself provides the ``controller'' function of modulating water flow. Heating coil type must be:
  {Coil:Heating:Electric}
  {Coil:Heating:Fuel}
  {Coil:Heating:Water}
  {Coil:Heating:Steam}
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Name 
HeatingCoilName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the furnace heating coil.
As shown in the example below, correct specification of the furnace requires specification of the following objects in addition to the furnace object:
1)~~~fan ({Fan:OnOff} or {Fan:ConstantVolume})
2)~~~heating coil ({Coil:Heating:Fuel} or {Coil:Heating:Electric})
3)~~~direct air unit ({AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:NoReheat}) for each zone served by the furnace
Note: the furnace's fan and heating coil must be connected in the air loop according to the configuration shown above (Figure{fig:schematic-of-blow-through-furnace-model}) when a blow through fan configuration is specified. If a draw through fan is used, the fan is located down stream of the heating coil. In addition, the volumetric air flow rate specified in the direct air unit for the controlling zone should properly reflect the fractional volumetric air flow rate specified in the furnace object.

This numeric field contains the design volumetric flow rate of the unitary system in cubic meters per second. This volumetric flow rate should match the flow rate specified for the unitary system fan.
```
	
##  Field: Controlling Zone or Thermostat Location 
ControllingZoneOrThermostatLocation
```
This alpha field contains the identifying zone name where the thermostat controlling the unitary system is located.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Fan Object Type 
SupplyFanObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the identifying type of supply air fan specified for the unitary system. Fan type must be {{Fan:OnOff}} or {{Fan:ConstantVolume}}. {Fan:ConstantVolume} is used when the Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule values are never 0 and the fan operates continuously. {Fan:OnOff} is used when the fan cycles on and off with the cooling or heating coil (i.e.~Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule values are at times 0).
```
	
##  Field: Supply Fan Name 
SupplyFanName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the unitary system fan.
```
	
##  Field: Fan Placement 
FanPlacement
```
This alpha field has two choices: {BlowThrough} or {DrawThrough}. The first choice stands for ``blow through fan''. This means that the unit consists of a fan followed by the heating coil. The fan ``blows through'' the heating coil. The second choice stands for ``draw through fan''. This means that the unit consists of the heating coil followed by a fan. The fan ``draws air through'' the heating coil. If this field is left blank, the default is blow through.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Object Type 
HeatingCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field contains the identifying type of heating coil specified in the unitary system. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connectors objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the heating coil does not require additional controller or {Controller:WaterCoil} object. The parent object (Unitary Heat Only) itself provides the ``controller'' function of modulating water flow. Heating coil type must be:
  {Coil:Heating:Electric}
  {Coil:Heating:Fuel}
  {Coil:Heating:Water}
  {Coil:Heating:Steam}
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Name 
HeatingCoilName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the unitary system heating coil.
As shown in the example below, correct specification of the heat-only unitary system requires specification of the following objects in addition to the unitary system object:
1)~~~fan ({Fan:OnOff} or {Fan:ConstantVolume})
2)~~~heating coil ({Coil:Heating:Fuel} or {Coil:Heating:Electric})
3)~~~direct air unit ({AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:NoReheat}) for each zone served by the furnace
Note: the unitary system's fan and heating coil must be connected in the air loop according to the configuration shown above (Figure{fig:schematic-of-blow-through-heat-only-unitary}) when a blow through fan configuration is specified. If a draw through fan is used, the fan is located down stream of the heating coil. In addition, the volumetric air flow rate specified in the direct air unit for the controlling zone should properly reflect the fractional volumetric air flow rate specified in the unitary system object.

# AirLoopHVACUnitaryHeatPumpWaterToAir

`AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:WaterToAir`
```
The unitary water-to-air heat pump is similar to the unitary air-to-air heat pump except water is used on the source side. Links to the fan, WaterToAirHeatPump cooling coil, WaterToAirHeatPump heating coil, and supplementary heating coil specifications are provided in the heat pump's input data syntax. The heat pump switches between cooling and heating depending on the zone's demand. The load side (air) of the unitary water-to-air heat pump consists of an On/Off fan component, a WaterToAirHeatPump cooling coil component, a WaterToAirHeatPump heating coil component, and a Gas, Electric, Steam, or Hot Water supplemental heating coil component. The source side (water) of the heat pump is connected to a condenser loop with a heat exchanger (ground heat exchanger or other type) or a plant loop with a heating source such as a boiler and a cooling source such as a chiller or cooling tower. The diagram below shows the setup and connection of the heat pump for the source side and load side for a ground heat exchanger configuration. Note that on the load side, the WaterToAirHeatPump cooling coil must always be placed before the WaterToAirHeatPump heating coil.
There are three type of WaterToAirHeatPump coil models available:
  {Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:ParameterEstimation}
  {Coil:Heating:WaterToAirHeatPump:ParameterEstimation}
  {Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit}
  {Coil:Heating:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit}
  {Coil:Cooling:Water}toAirHeat{Pump:VariableSpeed}EquationFit
  {Coil:Heating:Water}toAirHeat{Pump:VariableSpeed}EquationFit
In addition, the control zone name and the system design operating conditions are specified by the heat pump inputs.

```
	
##  Field: Heating Convergence 
HeatingConvergence
```
This numeric value allows the user to determine how close the air side has to be controlled. Lower the value of convergence better the control of air side conditions and less the zone temperature fluctuations. However in a poorly designed system, a lower convergence might result in warning errors which are caused due to the iteration limit for run time fraction calculation is limited to 20.
```

```
	
##  Field: Heat Pump Fan Delay Time 
HeatPumpFanDelayTime
```
This numeric field contains the time delay for the heat pump supply air fan to shut off after the compressor cycles off in seconds.

```
	
##  Field: Supplemental Heating Coil Object Type 
SupplementalHeatingCoilObjectType
```
This is the object type of the supplemental heating coil. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connectors objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the supplemental heating coil does not require additional controller or {Controller:WaterCoil} object. The parent object (AirLoop Unitary Water to Air Heat Pump) itself provides the ``controller'' function of modulating water flow. The valid choices are:
  {Coil:Heating:Electric}
  {Coil:Heating:Fuel}
  {Coil:Heating:Water}
  {Coil:Heating:Steam}
```
	
##  Field: Supplemental Heating Coil Name 
SupplementalHeatingCoilName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the supplemental heating coil, and should match the name specified in the corresponding supplemental heating coil object.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Supply Air Temperature from Supplemental Heater 
MaximumSupplyAirTemperatureFromSupplementalHeater
```
This numeric field defines the maximum allowed supply air temperature exiting the heat pump supplemental heating coil in degrees Celsius.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Supplemental Heater Operation 
MaximumOutdoorDryBulbTemperatureForSupplementalHeaterOperation
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature in degrees Celsius above which the heat pump supplemental heating coil is disabled. The temperature for this input field must be less than or equal to 21°C. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 21°C.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature Sensor Node Name 
OutdoorDryBulbTemperatureSensorNodeName
```
This alpha field specifies the name of the outdoor node which controls the operation of the supplemental heating coil. If this field is left blank, the outdoor temperature is based solely on the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be listed in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name must be specified in an {OutdoorAir:NodeList} object where the outdoor temperature is taken directly from the weather data.
```
	
##  Field: Fan Placement 
FanPlacement
```
This alpha field has two choices: {BlowThrough} or {DrawThrough}. The first choice represents a blow through system where the supply air fan is before the WaterToAirHeatPump cooling/heating coil and the supplementary heating coil. The second choice represents a draw through system where the supply fan is between the WaterToAirHeatPump cooling/heating coil and the supplementary heating coil. If this input field is left blank, the default is blow through.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name 
SupplyAirFanOperatingModeScheduleName
```
This alpha field specifies the name of the supply air fan operating mode schedule. The supply air fan operating mode may vary during the simulation based on time-of-day or with a change of season. Schedule values of 0 denote that the supply air fan and the heating/cooling coil cycle on and off together to meet the heating or cooling load (a.k.a. AUTO fan). Schedule values other than 0 denote that the supply air fan runs continuously while the heating or cooling coil cycles to meet the load. If this field is left blank, the model assumes the supply air fan cycles with the heating or cooling coil throughout the simulation period.
As shown in the example below, correct specification of the water-to-air heat pump requires specification of the following objects in addition to the AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:WaterToAir object:
  On/Off fan
  WaterToAirHeatPump cooling coil
  WaterToAirHeatPump heating coil
  Supplementary heating coil
  Direct air unit for each zone served by the heat pump
  Condenser demand branches
It should be noted that the volumetric air flow rate specified in the direct air unit for the controlling zone should properly reflect the fractional volumetric air flow rate specified in the heat pump object.
```
	
##  Field: Dehumidification Control Type 
DehumidificationControlType
```
This alpha input field contains the type of dehumidification control. The following options are valid for this field:
{None} - meet sensible load only, no active dehumidification control
{CoolReheat} - cool beyond the dry-bulb temperature set point as required to meet the high humidity setpoint. The excess cooling beyond the cooling set point temperature is offset by the supplemental heating coil.
The default is {None}. For {CoolReheat} dehumidification control modes, the maximum humidity setpoint is required. This must be set using a {{ZoneControl:Humidistat}} object. When extra dehumidification is required, the system may not be able to meet the humidity setpoint if its full capacity is not adequate. Supplemental heating coil (supplemental heating coil type and name) is a required input in WaterToAir HeatPumps. When dehumidification control is active the heating and the reheat load due to extra dehumidification are met with supplemetal heating coil. The supplemental heating coil capacity must be adequate enough to meet the heating coil load and offset the excess cooling load due to~ extra dehumidification. The dehumidification control type CoolReheat works only with {Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit} cooling coil type.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Pump Coil Water Flow Mode 
HeatPumpCoilWaterFlowMode
```
This field specifies the way in which water flow through the heat pump coils will be modeled.~ This field is only used when WatertoAirHeatPump:EquationFit coils are used. There are three options:
  Cycling
  Constant
  CyclingOnDemand
{Cycling} varies water flow through the coil based on the heat pump Part Load Ratio.~ This control method is appropriate for modeling heat pumps that are outfitted with a soleniod valve which allows water to flow through the coil only when the compressor is active. This is the default for EnergyPlus V8 and later.
{Constant} provides a constant water flow regardless of heat pump operation.~ Remember that EnergyPlus has two coils (a heating coil and a cooling coil) to approximate the operation of one coil that can operate in either heating mode or cooling mode.~ Therefore, when the water flow mode is constant, there will be full flow through either the heating coil or the cooling coil, but not both at the same time.
{ConstantOnDemand} provides full flow through the coil whenever there is a load.~ When there is no load, there is zero flow through the coil.~ This control strategy represents the way EnergyPlus modeled heat pump water flow prior to Version 8.

# AirLoopHVACUnitaryHeatCoolVAVChangeoverBypass

`AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool:VAVChangeoverBypass`
```
The changeover-bypass variable air volume (CBVAV) unitary system is a compound object made up of other components. Each CBVAV system consists of an outdoor air mixer, direct expansion (DX) cooling coil, heating coil, and a supply air fan as shown in the figures below. Zone thermostats and terminal units are required in each zone served by this system. The terminal units are specific to this system type and are either {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:Reheat} or {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:NoReheat}. A zone humidistat and single zone max humidity set point manager may also be specified to help control high humidity levels. These individual components are described elsewhere in this document. The system may also be connected to an inlet node of either the {AirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixer} or {AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenum} to more accurately model the {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem}. The CBVAV unitary system object coordinates the operation of these components and is modeled as a type of air loop equipment (Ref. {AirLoopHVAC}).
Links to the CBVAV system's supply air fan, coils, and outdoor air mixer specifications are provided in the object's input syntax. Additional inputs include system and outdoor air flow rates during heating and cooling operation, the priority control mode, and dehumidification control type. A description of each input field for the CBVAV unitary system compound object is provided below.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field defines a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a changeover-bypass VAV system. Any reference to this system by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the system operates during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the system must be off for that time period, and a schedule value greater than 0 denotes that the system is available to operate during that time period. This schedule may be used to completely disable the system (all of its coils and the supply air fan) as required. If this field is left blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Supply Air Flow Rate 
CoolingSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the air flow rate through the system (i.e., through the fan and heating/cooling coils) in cubic meters per second when the DX cooling coil is operating. Values must be greater than 0, or this field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Supply Air Flow Rate 
HeatingSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the air flow rate through the system (i.e., through the fan and heating/cooling coils) in cubic meters per second when the heating coil is operating. Values must be greater than 0, or this field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: No Load Supply Air Flow Rate 
NoLoadSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the air flow rate through the system (i.e., through the fan and heating/cooling coils) in cubic meters per second when neither cooling nor heating is required (i.e., the DX cooling coil and heating coil are off but the supply air fan operates). Values must be greater than or equal to zero, or this field is autosizable. This field is only used when the unitary system's supply air fan operating mode is specified as continuous fan operation (Ref. Field: Supply air fan operating mode schedule name). If the system's supply air fan operating mode is specified as continuous fan operation and this value is set to zero or the field is left blank, then the model assumes that the system air flow rate when no heating/cooling is needed is equal to the system air flow rate when the coils were last operating (for cooling operation or heating operation).
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate 
CoolingOutdoorAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the system (i.e., through the Outdoor air Mixer's Outside\_Air\_Stream\_Node) in cubic meters per second when the DX cooling coil is operating. Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate can be changed during the simulation using a multiplier schedule (Ref. Field: Outdoor air volumetric flow rate multiplier schedule name). For any simulation timestep, the Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate cannot exceed the system air volumetric flow rate during cooling operation.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate 
HeatingOutdoorAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the system (i.e., through the Outdoor air Mixer's Outside\_Air\_Stream\_Node) in cubic meters per second when the heating coil is operating. Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate can be changed during the simulation using a multiplier schedule (Ref. Field: Outdoor air volumetric flow rate multiplier schedule name). For any simulation timestep, the Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate cannot exceed the system air volumetric flow rate during heating operation.
```
	
##  Field: No Load Outdoor Air Flow Rate When No Cooling or Heating is Needed 
NoLoadOutdoorAirFlowRateWhenNoCoolingOrHeatingIsNeeded
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the system (i.e., through the Outdoor air Mixer's Outside\_Air\_Stream\_Node) in cubic meters per second when neither cooling nor heating is required (i.e., the DX cooling coil and heating coil are off but the supply air fan operates). Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the no load outdoor air flow rate can be changed during the simulation using a multiplier schedule (Ref. Field: Outdoor air volumetric flow rate multiplier schedule name). For any simulation timestep, the no load outdoor air flow rate cannot exceed the no load supply air flow rate. This field is only used when the unitary system's supply air fan operating mode is specified as continuous fan operation (Ref. Field: Supply air fan operating mode schedule name). If the system's supply air fan operating mode is specified as continuous fan operation and this value is set to zero or the field is left blank, then the model assumes that the no load outdoor air flow rate is equal to the outdoor air flow rate when the coils were last operating (for cooling operation [i.e.~Cooling outdoor air flow rate] or heating operation [i.e.~Heating outdoor air flow rate]) and this field is not used.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Flow Rate Multiplier Schedule Name 
OutdoorAirFlowRateMultiplierScheduleName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a schedule (ref: Schedule) that contains multipliers for the outdoor air volume flow rates (heating, cooling, no heating/cooling). Schedule values must be from zero to 1. If this field is left blank, then the model assumes that the outdoor air multiplier is 1 for the entire simulation period.
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node from which the system draws its inlet air.
```
	
##  Field: Bypass Duct Mixer Node Name 
BypassDuctMixerNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node where the bypass air mixes with the unitary system's inlet air. This name should match the name of the Return Air Stream Node Name for the {OutdoorAir:Mixer} associated with this system. This node name must be different from the system's air inlet node name.
```
	
##  Field: Bypass Duct Splitter Node Name 
BypassDuctSplitterNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node where the conditioned air is split into bypass air and supply air leaving the system (e.g., delivered to the terminal units). This splitter air node name should match the outlet node name for the last component (furthest downstream) in this unitary system. For blow through fan placement, the splitter air node is the outlet node of the heating coil. For draw through fan placement, the splitter node is the outlet node of the supply air fan.
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node to which the system sends its outlet air.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Mixer Object Type 
OutdoorAirMixerObjectType
```
This field specifies the type of outdoor air mixer used by this CBVAV unitary system. The outdoor air mixer component is part of the CBVAV unitary compound object. The only available outdoor air mixer type is:
  {OutdoorAir:Mixer}
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Mixer Name 
OutdoorAirMixerName
```
This alpha field defines the name of an outdoor air mixer component that composes part of the CBVAV system. The name of the outdoor air mixer's Return\_Air\_Stream\_Node should match the bypass duct mixer node name, and be different from the CBVAV system's air inlet node name. The Mixed Air Node Name of the outdoor air mixer should be the same as the CBVAV system's supply fan inlet air node (for blow through fan placement) or the system's DX cooling coil inlet node (for draw through fan placement).
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Object Type 
SupplyAirFanObjectType
```
This alpha field defines the type of fan used by this unitary system. The only valid choices are {{Fan:SystemModel}}, {{Fan:OnOff}}, and {{Fan:ConstantVolume}}. The input requirements for these fan objects are described elsewhere in this document.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Name 
SupplyAirFanName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the fan component that composes part of this unitary system. Note that the fan component's maximum flow rate should be greater than or equal to the largest system air volumetric flow rate specified for this unitary system (heating, cooling, and no heating/cooling). In addition, the fan's inlet air node should be the same as the outdoor air mixer's Mixed Air Node (for blow through fan placement) or the heating coil's outlet node (for draw through fan placement). The fan outlet air node should be the same as the DX cooling coil's air inlet node (for blow through fan placement) or the system's bypass duct splitter node (for draw through fan placement).
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Placement 
SupplyAirFanPlacement
```
This alpha field defines the placement of the supply air fan within this unitary system. The only valid choices are {BlowThrough} and {DrawThrough}. With blow through placement, the supply air fan is located immediately upstream of the system's cooling coil. With draw through placement, the supply air fan is located immediately downstream of the heating coil.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name 
SupplyAirFanOperatingModeScheduleName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a schedule that specifies the supply air fan operating mode during the simulation. A schedule value of 0 denotes the fan cycles off when no cooling or heating is required, and any other value denotes that the fan runs continuously regardless of the need for heating or cooling. If this field is left blank, the model assumes continuous supply air fan operation for the entire simulation period.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Coil Object Type 
CoolingCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field defines the type of cooling coil used by this unitary system. There are three valid choices for this field:
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed}
  {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode}
The input requirements for these cooling coil objects are described elsewhere in this document.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Coil Name 
CoolingCoilName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the cooling coil used by this unitary system, and this name should match the name specified in the corresponding cooling coil object.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Object Type 
HeatingCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field defines the type of heating coil used by this unitary system. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connector objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the heating coil does not require additional controller or {Controller:WaterCoil} object. The parent object (CBVAV Unitary System) itself provides the ``controller'' function of modulating water flow. The valid choices are:
  {Coil:Heating:Electric}
  {Coil:Heating:Fuel}
  {Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed}
  {Coil:Heating:DX:VariableSpeed}
  {Coil:Heating:Water}
  {Coil:Heating:Steam}
The input requirements for these heating coil objects are described elsewhere in this document.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Name 
HeatingCoilName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the heating coil used by this unitary system, and this name should match the name specified in the corresponding heating coil object.
```
	
##  Field: Priority Control Mode 
PriorityControlMode
```
This choice field defines the cooling or heating priority control mode for the unitary system. Valid choices are:
  CoolingPriority
  HeatingPriority
  ZonePriority
  LoadPriority
If CoolingPriority is selected, the system operates to meet the cooling load if any zone served by this system (air loop) requires cooling. If no zones require cooling, then the system operates in heating mode if needed. If HeatingPriority is selected, the system operates to meet the heating load if any zone requires heating. If no zones require heating, then the system operates in cooling mode if needed. If ZonePriority is selected, the system operates based on the maximum number of zones requiring either heating or cooling. If the number of zones requiring cooling is greater than the number of zones requiring heating, then the system operates in cooling mode. If the number of zones requiring heating is greater than the number of zones requiring cooling, then the system operates in heating mode. If the number of zones requiring cooling equals the number of zones requiring heating, then the largest combined load (i.e., the sum of the cooling loads for zones requiring cooling compared to the sum of the heating loads for zones that require heating) sets the cooling or heating operating mode for the system during that simulation timestep. If LoadPriority is selected, the system operates based on the largest combined load (i.e., the sum of the cooling loads for zones requiring cooling compared to the sum of the heating loads for zones that require heating). If the toal load for zones requiring cooling is greater than the toal load for zones requiring heating, then the system operates in cooling mode. Similar logic is used for heating mode selection. If the toal cooling load equals the toal heating load, then cooling or heating operation reverts to the total number of zones requiring cooling or heating (and if equal reverts to cooling mode if the cooling load is non-zero, otherwise, heating mode.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Outlet Air Temperature During Cooling Operation 
MinimumOutletAirTemperatureDuringCoolingOperation
```
This numeric field defines the minimum outlet air temperature leaving the system when the unit is operating to provide cooling. Values are specified in degrees Celsius and must be greater than 0. The default value is 8°C. This value must be less than or equal to the maximum outlet air temperature during heating operation.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Outlet Air Temperature During Heating Operation 
MaximumOutletAirTemperatureDuringHeatingOperation
```
This numeric field defines the maximum outlet air temperature leaving the system when the unit is operating to provide heating. Values are specified in degrees Celsius and must be greater than 0. The default value is 50°C. This value must be greater than or equal to the minimum outlet air temperature during cooing operation.
```
	
##  Field: Dehumidification Control Type 
DehumidificationControlType
```
This alpha field contains the type of dehumidification control. The following options are valid for this field:
{None} - meet sensible load only, no active dehumidification control
{Multimode} - activate enhanced dehumidification mode as needed and meet sensible load. This option is used to model DX equipment with a controllable heat exchanger assisting the DX cooling coil for improved dehumidification. It is valid only with cooling coil type = {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode}.
{CoolReheat} - cool beyond the dry-bulb temperature set point as required to meet the high humidity setpoint. It is valid only with cooling coil type = {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode}.
The default is {None}. For the other dehumidification control modes, the maximum humidity setpoint on the CBVAV system's air outlet node is used. This must be set using a {{ZoneControl:Humidistat}} and one of:
  {{SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum}}
  {{SetpointManager:MultiZone:Humidity:Maximum}}
  {{SetpointManager:MultiZone:MaximumHumidity:Average}}
objects. When extra dehumidification is required, the system may not be able to meet the humidity setpoint if its full capacity is not adequate.
```
	
##  Field: Plenum or Mixer Inlet Node Name 
PlenumOrMixerInletNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node where the bypass air enters the zone mixer or return plenum. This node name must be different from the system's {{Air Outlet Node Name}} and {{Bypass Duct Splitter Node Name}}. This name should match the name of the inlet node in the {AirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixer} or {AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenum} associated with this system.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Runtime Before Operating Mode Change 
MinimumRuntimeBeforeOperatingModeChange
```
This numeric field defines the amount of time, in hours, the HVAC system operates before a mode change is allowed. The value entered must be greater than or equal to 0. The default value is 0.25 hours if this input is present and blank. If this field is not present the minimum runtime is 0 hours (i.e., immediate change over as needed).
\medskip
As shown in the example below, correct specification of the CBVAV unitary system requires specification of the following objects in addition to the AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool:VAVChangeoverBypass object:
1)~~~outdoor air mixer ({OutdoorAir:Mixer})
2)~~~fan ({Fan:SystemModel}, {Fan:OnOff}, or {Fan:ConstantVolume})
3)~~~cooling coil ({Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed}, {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted}, or {Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode})
4)~~~heating coil ({Coil:Heating:Fuel}, {Coil:Heating:Electric}, or {Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed})
5)~~~terminal unit for each zone being served by this system ({AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:Reheat} or {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:NoReheat})
6)~~~When the Plenum or Mixer Inlet Node Name is specified, this node name must connect to either the {AirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixer} or {AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenum} and the {AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem} may then be used to control the outdoor air flow rates. When using the AirloopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem it is recommended that the Cooling, Heating and No Load Outdoor Air Flow Rate inputs are set to 0, otherwise the amount of outdoor air is increased and the coils may not autosize properly.
Note: The fan, heating coil, cooling coil, and outdoor air mixer must be connected in the air loop according to the configurations shown above (Figure{fig:schematic-of-a-cbvav-unitary-system-draw}, Figure{fig:schematic-of-a-cbvav-unitary-system-blow} or Figure{fig:schematic-of-a-cbvav-unitary-system-used-with-outdoor-air-system}).

This numeric field defines the maximum outdoor temperature, in degrees Celsius, below which the crankcase heater will operate. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0°C. This field is only used to calculate crankcase heater power and has no impact on heat pump performance.
```
	
##  Field: Defrost Strategy 
DefrostStrategy
```
This alpha field has two choices: reverse-cycle or resistive. If the reverse-cycle strategy is selected, the heating cycle is reversed periodically to provide heat to melt frost accumulated on the outdoor coil. If a resistive defrost strategy is selected, the frost is melted using an electric resistance heater. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost strategy is reverse-cycle. Defrost can be disabled by entering a resistive defrost strategy using a timed defrost control, a 0 defrost time period fraction and a 0 resistive defrost heater capacity in the following inputs fields. This method is used when the Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation field value is greater than the expected minimum outdoor dry-bulb temperature simulated in the weather file.
```
	
##  Field: Defrost Control 
DefrostControl
```
This alpha field has two choices: timed or on-demand. If timed control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on a fixed value of compressor runtime whether or not frost has actually accumulated. For timed defrost control, the fractional amount of time the unit is in defrost is entered in the input field ``Defrost Time Period Fraction'' described below. If on-demand defrost control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on outdoor weather (humidity ratio) conditions. Regardless of which defrost control is selected, defrost does not occur above the user specified outdoor temperature entered in the input field ``Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation'' described above. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost control is timed.
```
	
##  Field: Defrost Energy Input Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve Name 
DefrostEnergyInputRatioModifierFunctionOfTemperatureCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) during reverse-cycle defrost periods as a function of the weighted average wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor terminal units (variable x) and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (variable y). The output of this curve is multiplied by the coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the indoor and outdoor coils are operating. The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point conditions.
```
	
##  Field: Defrost Time Period Fraction 
DefrostTimePeriodFraction
```
This numeric field defines the fraction of compressor runtime when the defrost cycle is active. For example, if the defrost cycle is active for 3.5 minutes for every 60 minutes of compressor runtime, then the user should enter 3.5/60 = 0.058333. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.058333.
```
	
##  Field: Resistive Defrost Heater Capacity 
ResistiveDefrostHeaterCapacity
```
This numeric field defines the capacity of the resistive defrost heating element in Watts. This input field is used only when the selected defrost strategy is `resistive' (see input field ``Defrost Strategy'' above). The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation 
MaximumOutdoorDryBulbTemperatureForDefrostOperation
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which outdoor coil defrosting is disabled. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 5°C.

```
	
##  Field: Condenser Type 
CondenserType
```
This choice field defines the configuration of the heat pump condenser. Valid choices are {AirCooled}, {EvaporativelyCooled}, and {WaterCooled}.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Inlet Node Name 
CondenserInletNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the condenser inlet air or water node. For Condenser type = AirCooled, this node name should also be listed in an {OutdoorAir:Node} or {OutdoorAir:NodeList} object. If this field is blank, the model assumes an air-cooled condenser and the weather file is used to define the outdoor conditions entering the condenser. If this field is not blank, the node conditions are used to define the outdoor air or inlet water conditions entering the condenser. A node name is typically entered here for air-cooled systems when conditions other than those found in the weather file should be used (ref. {OutdoorAir:Node} related to height above ground).
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Outlet Node Name 
CondenserOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the condenser outlet water node. This field is only used for water-cooled systems.
```
	
##  Field: Water Condenser Volume Flow Rate

```
	
##  Field: Evaporative Condenser Effectiveness 
EvaporativeCondenserEffectiveness
```
The effectiveness of the evaporative condenser, which is used to determine the temperature of the air entering the outdoor condenser coil as follows:
Tcond inlet =  \left( {Twb,o} \right)   +   \left( {1 - EvapCondEffectiveness} \right)\left( {Tdb,o   - Twb,o} \right)
where
{T_{cond\\ inlet}} = the temperature of the air entering the condenser coil (°C)
{T_{wb,o}} = the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (°C)
{T_{db,o}} = the dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (°C)
The resulting condenser inlet air temperature is used by the Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Cooling Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature). The default value for this field is 0.9, although valid entries can range from 0.0 to 1.0. This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled and the simulation is calculating heating performance.
If the user wants to model an air-cooled condenser, they should simply specify AirCooled in the field Condenser Type. In this case, the Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Cooling Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature.
If the user wishes to model an evaporative-cooled condenser AND they have performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = EvapCooled and the evaporative condenser effectiveness value should be entered as 1.0. In this case, the Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Cooling Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil.
If the user wishes to model an air-cooled condenser that has evaporative media placed in front of it to cool the air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = EvapCooled. The user must also enter the appropriate evaporative effectiveness for the media. In this case, the Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Cooling Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Be aware that the evaporative media will significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the condenser coil, so the Cooling Capacity and Cooling EIR Modifier Curves must be valid for the expected range of dry-bulb temperatures that will be entering the condenser coil.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporative Condenser Air Flow Rate 
EvaporativeCondenserAirFlowRate
```
The air volume flow rate, in {\volumeFlowRate}, entering the evaporative condenser. This value is used to calculate the amount of water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air.

This field is not used when Condenser Type = AirCooled.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporative Condenser Pump Rated Power Consumption 
EvaporativeCondenserPumpRatedPowerConsumption
```

##  Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature 
BasinHeaterSetpointTemperature

This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2°C, and the default value is 2°C if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name 
BasinHeaterOperatingScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled.

##  Field: Fuel Type 
FuelType
```
This alpha field determines the type of fuel that this variable refrigerant flow system uses.~ This field has seven choices: Electricity, NaturalGas, Propane, Diesel, Gasoline, FuelOilNo1, FuelOilNo2, OtherFuel1, and OtherFuel2. The default is Electricity. The use of alternate fuel types assumes an engine drives the variable speed compression system and also accounts for condenser air flow (i.e., a fan attached to the engine provides air flow through the outdoor condenser.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Condenser Inlet Node Temperature in Heat Recovery Mode

```
	
##  Field: Heat Recovery Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve Name 
HeatRecoveryCoolingCapacityModifierCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the cooling capacity modifier when heat recovery mode is active.

This curve is either a bi-quadratic equation using weighted average indoor temperature (i.e., the indoor terminal units weighted average inlet temperatures) and condenser entering air temperature as the independent variables or a cubic curve based on part-load ratio. This performance curve can be used to describe the cooling capacity modifier as either a constant (e.g., temperature or part-load ratio term coefficients are 0), a cooling modifier that varies with either indoor temperature and/or outdoor temperature, or part-load ratio (e.g., one or more temperature or part-load ratio term coefficients are 0), or varies with both indoor and outdoor temperatures or part-load ratio (e.g., all temperature or part-load ratio term coefficients are non-zero). If this field is left blank, and heat recovery operating mode is selected, the default constant modifier is 0.9. This modifier is applied only when heat recovery mode is active. To model a heat recovery system which has no degradation in cooling performance when heat recovery mode is active, or if the degradation is not constant at different operating conditions, a performance curve object must be used. This input is only used when Heat Pump Waste Heat Recovery is selected as Yes and the system changes from cooling only mode to heat recovery mode.

This performance curve can be used to describe the cooling energy modifier as either a constant (e.g., temperature term coefficients are 0), a cooling energy modifier that varies with indoor and/or outdoor temperatures (e.g., one or more temperature term coefficients are 0), or varies with both indoor and outdoor temperatures (e.g., temperature term coefficients are non-zero). If this field is left blank, and heat recovery operating mode is selected, the default constant modifier is 1.1. This modifier is applied only when heat recovery mode is active. To model a heat recovery system which has no degradation in cooling performance when heat recovery mode is active, or if the degradation is not constant at different operating conditions, a performance curve object must be used.

The output of this curve is multiplied by the coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the indoor and outdoor coils are operating.

# ZoneTerminalUnitList

`ZoneTerminalUnitList`
```
The zone terminal unit list defines the names of the terminal units connected to a single variable refrigerant flow air-conditioning system. The zone terminal unit list is used exclusively in the variable refrigerant flow (VRF) air conditioner object (ref: {AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow}). Up to 20 terminal units may be connected to a single VRF outdoor condensing unit. This list is extensible if additional indoor terminal units are required. The name of this zone terminal unit list object is then input into the corresponding variable refrigerant flow air conditioner object. The following figure demonstrates this concept.
```

##  Field: Zone Terminal List Name 
ZoneTerminalListName
```
This alpha field specifies the name of the zone terminal unit list. This name must be specified in the {AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow} object.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Terminal Unit Name <x> 
ZoneTerminalUnitNameX
```
This alpha field defines the name of the zone terminal unit used in a variable refrigerant air conditioner. The zone terminal unit must be connected to a zone using the {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections} object. The terminal unit air inlet node is the same name as a zone exhaust node. The terminal unit air outlet node is the same name as a zone inlet node.  This object is extensible, so additional fields of this type can be added to the end of this object.
Following is an example input for a ZoneTerminalUnitList object.

# StandardRatings

`Standard Ratings`
```
The EIO file reports the industry standard ratings of Recovery Efficiency and Energy Factor for water heater objects. The rating method is based on the GAMA and 10CFR430 test procedures. Under certain input parameters, the rating method will not succeed and a warning message will be generated. Problems occur when inputs do not allow the tank to recover to the setpoint temperature within the test period. This can occur if the maximum heater capacity is undersized, or if the deadband temperature difference is large enough that the first draw of the test does not trigger the heater to come on. In either case, the Recovery Efficiency test will not compute properly because recovery to the setpoint was not achieved.
Standard ratings for storage-only water tanks (Heater Maximum Capacity = 0) cannot be calculated and do not report anything in the EIO file.
```

# WaterHeaterMixed

`WaterHeater:Mixed`
```
The WaterHeater:Mixed object analytically solves the differential equation governing the energy balance of the water tank. Within a timestep, conditions are solved separately for when the heater element or burner is ``on'' (on-cycle) and when it is ``off'' (off-cycle). This approach allows ambient losses and parasitic loads to be divided into on-cycle and off-cycle effects and accounted for in detail.
For losses to the ambient environment, the ambient air temperature can be taken from a schedule, a zone, or the exterior. When used with a zone, a fraction of the skin losses can be added to the zone heat balance as internal heat gains.
Control options allow the heater to cycle or modulate to meet the load. When cycling, the heater element or burner is either on or off. The heater remains fully on while heating the tank up to the setpoint temperature. When the setpoint is reached, the heater turns off. The heater remains off until the tank temperature falls below the ``cut-in'' temperature, i.e., the setpoint temperature minus the deadband temperature difference. The heater continuously cycles on and off to maintain the tank temperature within the deadband. Most storage-tank water heaters cycle.
When modulating, the heater power varies between the maximum and minimum heater capacities. The heater stays on as long as the required total demand is above the minimum capacity. Below the minimum capacity, the heater will begin to cycle on and off based on the deadband temperature difference. Equipment is usually designed and rated to avoid this condition. Most tankless/instantaneous water heaters modulate.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
The name of the WaterHeater:Mixed object.
```
	
##  Field: Tank Volume 
TankVolume
```
The volume of the storage tank [m^{3}].~ This field is autosizable if used with a Water Heater:Sizing object.~ Although this field is allowed to go down to zero, even so-called ``tankless'' water heaters have some volume of water that is maintained around the heating elements or in the heat exchanger, typically around 0.00379 m^{3} (1 gallon).
```
	
##  Field: Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name 
SetpointTemperatureScheduleName
```
The reference to the schedule object specifying the hot water temperature setpoint [°C]. Also known as the ``cut-out'' temperature.
```
	
##  Field: Deadband Temperature Difference 
DeadbandTemperatureDifference
```
The delta temperature difference [$Δ{°}C$] between the setpoint and the ``cut-in'' temperature at which the heater will turn on. In other words, the ``cut-in'' temperature is Setpoint -- Deadband.
One note here is that if a source side connection exists, how this {Deadband Temperature Difference} is used is dependent on the ``{Source Side Flow Control Mode}''[{field-source-side-flow-control-mode}] choice. If {Source Side Flow Control Mode} is {IndirectHeatPrimarySetpoint} or
{IndirectHeatAlternateSetpoint}, the target ``cut-in'' temperature is the related Setpoint -- Deadband as described above. However, when the {Source Side Flow Control Mode} setting is {StorageTank}, the deadband is not used in getting the ``cut-in'' temperature---in this case it is just directly using the corresponding Setpoint temperature without subtracting off the Deadband Temperature Difference.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Temperature Limit 
MaximumTemperatureLimit
```
The temperature [°C] at which the tank water becomes dangerously hot and is vented through boiling or an automatic safety. The tank temperature will never exceed the maximum. Any extra heat added to the tank is immediately vented. Note:~ The maximum temperature must be greater than the setpoint temperature at all times.
```
	
##  Field: Heater Control Type 
HeaterControlType
```
The control type can be {Cycle} or {Modulate}. Cycle is appropriate for most storage tank-type water heaters. Modulate is appropriate for most instantaneous/tankless water heaters.
```
	
##  Field: Heater Maximum Capacity 
HeaterMaximumCapacity
```
The maximum heat rate [W] that can be supplied to the water, probably the same as the ``nominal'' capacity.~ This field is autosizable if used with a Water Heater:Sizing object.
```
	
##  Field: Heater Minimum Capacity 
HeaterMinimumCapacity
```
The minimum heat rate [W] that can be supplied to the water. This field is only used when the Heater Control Type is {Modulate}. If the total demand rate for heating is less than the minimum, even a modulating water heater will begin to cycle.
```
	
##  Field: Heater Ignition Minimum Flow Rate 
HeaterIgnitionMinimumFlowRate
```
NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.
```
	
##  Field: Heater Ignition Delay 
HeaterIgnitionDelay
```
NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.
```
	
##  Field: Heater Fuel Type 
HeaterFuelType
```
The type of fuel used for heating. The fuel type can be Electricity, NaturalGas, Propane, FuelOilNo1, FuelOilNo2, Coal, Diesel, Gasoline, Steam, OtherFuel1, OtherFuel2 or {DistrictHeating}.
```
	
##  Field: Heater Thermal Efficiency 
HeaterThermalEfficiency
```
The thermal conversion efficiency from fuel energy to heat energy for the heater element or burner. This is not the same as the overall efficiency of the water heater.
```
	
##  Field: Part Load Factor Curve Name 
PartLoadFactorCurveName
```
The reference to the curve object that relates the overall efficiency of the water heater to the Runtime Fraction (if Control Type {Cycle}) or Part Load Ratio (if Control Type {Modulate}). This is an additional multiplier applied to the Heater Thermal Efficiency to compute fuel energy use. The Part Load Factor Curve should not have a value less than 0.1 in the domain from 0 to 1. If the Part Load Factor Curve accounts for ambient losses and/or parasitic fuel consumption, these effects should not also be input into the related fields in this object as that would result in double-counting.
```
	
##  Field: Off-Cycle Parasitic Fuel Consumption Rate 
OffCycleParasiticFuelConsumptionRate
```
Off-cycle parasitics include parts of the water heater that consume fuel when the heater is off, for example, a pilot light, or stand-by electronic control circuits. The fuel consumption rate [W] is strictly the total fuel that is consumed by all of the off-cycle parasitics.
```
	
##  Field: Off-Cycle Parasitic Fuel Type 
OffCycleParasiticFuelType
```
The type of fuel used by the off-cycle parasitics. The fuel type can be Electricity, NaturalGas, Propane, FuelOilNo1, FuelOilNo2, Coal, Diesel, Gasoline, Steam, OtherFuel1, OtherFuel2 or {DistrictHeating}. The fuel type can be the same or different from the Heater Fuel Type.
```
	
##  Field: Off-Cycle Parasitic Heat Fraction to Tank 
OffCycleParasiticHeatFractionToTank
```
The fraction of off-cycle parasitic fuel energy that is converted to heat energy that ends up in the tank water. For example, a pilot light would deliver most of its heat to the tank water, as long as the thermal conversion efficiency must be taken into account, so perhaps 0.80 is reasonable. Electronic control circuits, on the other hand, do not add any heat to the tank and should be 0.
```
	
##  Field: On-Cycle Parasitic Fuel Consumption Rate 
OnCycleParasiticFuelConsumptionRate
```
On-cycle parasitics include parts of the water heater that consume fuel when the heater is on, for example, an induction fan, or stand-by electronic control circuits. The fuel consumption rate [W] is strictly the total fuel that is consumed by all of the on-cycle parasitics.
```
	
##  Field: On-Cycle Parasitic Fuel Type 
OnCycleParasiticFuelType
```
The type of fuel used by the on-cycle parasitics. The fuel type can be Electricity, NaturalGas, Propane, FuelOilNo1, FuelOilNo2, Coal, Diesel, Gasoline, Steam, OtherFuel1, OtherFuel2 or {DistrictHeating}. The fuel type can be the same or different from the Heater Fuel Type.
```
	
##  Field: On-Cycle Parasitic Heat Fraction to Tank 
OnCycleParasiticHeatFractionToTank
```
The fraction of on-cycle parasitic fuel energy that is converted to heat energy that ends up in the tank water. For example, an induction fan might (maybe) deliver a small fraction of its energy to the tank water for a value of 0.05. Electronic control circuits, on the other hand, do not add any heat to the tank and should be 0.
```
	
##  Field: Ambient Temperature Indicator 
AmbientTemperatureIndicator
```
The Ambient Temperature Indicator specifies how the ambient air temperature will be indicated. The field can be {Schedule}, {Zone}, or {Outdoors}. If {Schedule} is used, the Ambient Temperature Schedule field provides the ambient temperature. If {Zone} is used, the zone air temperature of the zone specified in the Ambient Temperature Zone field provides the ambient temperature.

```
This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the ambient conditions surrounding the water heater tank. This field is applicable only when the Ambient Temperature Indicator is specified as {Outdoors}, otherwise this field should be left blank. The node name specified must also be specified in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an {OutdoorAir:NodeList} object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.
```
	
##  Field: Off-Cycle Loss Coefficient to Ambient Temperature 
OffCycleLossCoefficientToAmbientTemperature
```
The loss coefficient [W/K] to the ambient air temperature. Often this coefficient is identical to the ``UA'' for skin losses. However, it can also be used to model the loss effects of the flue in a combustion water heater, in addition to the skin losses.
```
	
##  Field: Off-Cycle Loss Fraction to Zone 
OffCycleLossFractionToZone
```
If the Ambient Temperature Indicator is {Zone}, this field adds the specified fraction of the off-cycle losses to the zone heat balance as an internal gain.
```
	
##  Field: On-Cycle Loss Coefficient to Ambient Temperature 
OnCycleLossCoefficientToAmbientTemperature
```
The loss coefficient [W/K] to the ambient air temperature. Often this coefficient is identical to the ``UA'' for skin losses. If the loss effects of the flue are being modeled in the Off-Cycle Loss Coefficient, than this field would have a different value accounting only for the skin losses.
```
	
##  Field: On-Cycle Loss Fraction to Zone 
OnCycleLossFractionToZone

```
	
##  Field: Use Side Effectiveness 
UseSideEffectiveness
```
This field specifies the heat transfer effectiveness between the use side water and the tank water. If the effectiveness is set to 1 then complete heat transfer occurs, simulating perfect mixing of the use side water and the tank water. If the effectiveness is lower, then the use side outlet water temperature will not be as hot as the tank water, simulating a heat exchanger.
```
	
##  Field: Source Side Inlet Node Name 
SourceSideInletNodeName
```
The inlet node connection to the plant loop for the source side of the water heater. Typically the source side draws cold water from the tank and returns warmer water.
The source side volume flow rate is obtained from the plant loop.

```
	
##  Field: Use Side Design Flow Rate 
UseSideDesignFlowRate
```
This field is optional and is used to specify the design flow rate through the Use Side of the water heater.~ The volumetric design flow rate is specified in m^{3}/s.~ The field is needed when the Use Side is connected to a plant loop.~ The field can be autosized.~ If autosized, then the input file should include a Plant Sizing object for the plant loop.~ Sizing results are reported in the EIO file.
```

```
	
##  Field: Source Side Flow Control Mode 
SourceSideFlowControlMode

This field is optional and is used to provide control over the logic used by the source side of the water heater to request flow. There are three choices for different modes: IndirectHeatPrimarySetpoint, IndirectHeatAlternateSetpoint, or StorageTank.~~~ The mode called IndirectHeatPrimarySetpoint is the historical behavior prior to version 8.1.~ In this mode the water heater will request flow at the source side when the main setpoint, in the input field called Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name, and deadband call for the tank to be heated.~ This mode is typical for a water heater indirectly heated by a boiler.~ The mode called IndirectHeatAlternateSetpoint is similar but it bases its control decisions on an alternate setpoint given in the following field.~ This mode is useful when the indirect source of heat may not satisfy the load and an internal heater is used for backup.~ The mode called StorageTank is for a passive tank and it always requests flow unless the tank temperature is equal to or higher than the maximum limit given in the input field called Maximum Temperature Limit.
```
	
##  Field: Indirect Alternate Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name 
IndirectAlternateSetpointTemperatureScheduleName
```
This field is optional and is used to provide a schedule with alternate setpoints for use with the IndirectHeatAlternateSetpoint mode in the previous field.~ The input field should contain a reference to a schedule object specifying the hot water temperature setpoint [°C] to use as the ``cut-out'' temperature for control logic at the source side.
```
	
##  Field: End-Use Subcategory 
EndUseSubcategory
```
This optional field allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Process''. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref: {Output:Meter} objects).

# WaterHeaterStratified

`WaterHeater:Stratified`
```
The WaterHeater:Stratified object divides the water tank into multiple nodes of equal volume. The nodes are coupled by vertical conduction effects, internode fluid flow, and temperature inversion mixing. The object simultaneously solves the differential equations governing the energy balances on the nodes using a numerical method. The system timestep is divided into many small substeps that allow the simulation to capture events that occur on a very short time scale. This approach allows ambient losses and parasitic loads to be divided into on-cycle and off-cycle effects and accounted for in detail.
For losses to the ambient environment, the ambient air temperature can be taken from a schedule, a zone, or the exterior. When used with a zone, a fraction of the skin losses can be added to the zone heat balance as internal heat gains.
The WaterHeater:Stratified object allows two heating elements to be simulated. The two elements can cycle on and off to maintain the node temperature within the deadband. The Heater Priority Control field determines how the heaters work together. There are two options:~ MasterSlave or Simultaneous. In the MasterSlave option, Heater 1 is the master and Heater 2 is the slave. That is, both heaters are not allowed to turn on at the same time. If the thermostats ask for heat at both Heater 1 and 2, only Heater 1 will turn on. Once Heater 1 has met the set point, it turns off and Heater 2 can turn on, if necessary. In the Simultaneousoption, Heater 1 and Heater 2 can turn on and off independently.~ Autosizing is available for only Heater 1.

Allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., ``Laundry'', ``Dish Washing'', etc. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory~ (ref: {Output:Meter} objects). Subcategories are also reported in the ABUPS table under the ``Water Systems'' end-use category and also appear in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the water use will be assigned to the ``General'' end-use subcategory.
```
	
##  Field: Tank Volume 
TankVolume
```
The actual volume [m3] of fluid in the tank. This field is autosizable if used with a Water Heater:Sizing object.~ The actual volume is typically not equal to the nominal volume specified by the manufacturer. Actual volume is almost always 10% lower for electric water heaters, and 5% lower for gas water heaters (Burch and Erickson 2004).

```
	
##  Field: Tank Height 
TankHeight
```
The height [m] of the tank. For the {HorizontalCylinder} shape (see below) the height of the tank is the measure in the axial direction, i.e., the height if you were to stand the cylinder up on its end. This field is autosizable if used with a Water Heater:Sizing object.
```
	
##  Field: Tank Shape 
TankShape
```
The tank shape determines the size and skin losses of the stratified nodes. There are three options:~ {VerticalCylinder}, {HorizontalCylinder}, and {Other}.
{VerticalCylinder} describes most upright residential water heaters.
HorizontalCylinder describes a few specialty water heaters and large commercial storage tanks. HorizontalCylinder can also be used to model an outdoor storage tank located above a solar collector in a thermosiphon configuration. HorizontalCylinder implies that the tank is divided into nodes of equal mass, but not equal height.
Other describes water heaters or storage tanks that have a uniform horizontal cross-section, but are not cylinders, e.g., a cuboid or other shape. The length of the perimeter is then specified by the Tank Perimeter field.
If blank, the default shape is {VerticalCylinder}.
```
	
##  Field: Tank Perimeter 
TankPerimeter
```
The length of the tank perimeter [m]. This field is only used if Tank Shape is {Other}.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Temperature Limit 
MaximumTemperatureLimit
```
The temperature [°C] at which the tank water becomes dangerously hot and is vented through boiling or an automatic safety. The tank temperature will never exceed the maximum. Any extra heat added to the tank is immediately vented. Note:~ The maximum temperature must be greater than the setpoint temperature at all times.
```
	
##  Field: Heater Priority Control 
HeaterPriorityControl
```
The heater priority control determines how Heater 1 and Heater 2 work together. There are two options:~ {MasterSlave} or {Simultaneous}. In the MasterSlave option, Heater 1 is the master and Heater 2 is the slave. In most residential electric water heaters, the heaters operate in a MasterSlave relationship. That is, both heaters are not allowed to turn on at the same time. If the thermostats ask for heat at both Heater 1 and 2, only Heater 1 will turn on. Once Heater 1 has met the set point, it turns off and Heater 2 can turn on, if necessary. In other words, only one heater can be on at any time, and Heater 1 is always has priority over Heater 2.
In the Simultaneous option, Heater 1 and Heater 2 can turn on and off independently.
If blank, the default is {MasterSlave}.
```
	
##  Field: Heater 1 Set Point Temperature Schedule Name 
Heater1SetPointTemperatureScheduleName
```

##  Field: Heater 1 Deadband Temperature Difference 
Heater1DeadbandTemperatureDifference
```
The delta temperature difference [??°C] between the set point and the ``cut-in'' temperature at which Heater 1 will turn on. In other words, the ``cut-in'' temperature is Set Point -- Deadband.
```
	
##  Field: Heater 1 Capacity 
Heater1Capacity
```
The heat rate [W] supplied to the water for Heater 1, probably the same as the ``nominal'' capacity. For residential electric water heaters, heating elements are usually 4500 W.~ This field is autosizable if used with a Water Heater:Sizing object.
```
	
##  Field: Heater 1 Height 
Heater1Height
```
The height [m] of Heater 1 in the tank.
```
	
##  Field: Heater 2 Set Point Temperature Schedule Name 
Heater2SetPointTemperatureScheduleName
```

```
	
##  Field: Heater 2 Deadband Temperature Difference 
Heater2DeadbandTemperatureDifference
```
The delta temperature difference [$Δ{°}C$] between the set point and the ``cut-in'' temperature at which Heater 2 will turn on. In other words, the ``cut-in'' temperature is Set Point -- Deadband.
One note here is that if a source side connection exists, how this {Deadband Temperature Difference} is used is dependent on the ``{Source Side Flow Control Mode}''[{field-source-side-flow-control-mode-1}] choice. If {Source Side Flow Control Mode} is {IndirectHeatPrimarySetpoint} or
{IndirectHeatAlternateSetpoint}, the target ``cut-in'' temperature is the related Setpoint -- Deadband as described above. However, when the {Source Side Flow Control Mode} setting is {StorageTank}, the deadband is not used in getting the ``cut-in'' temperature---in this case it is just directly using the corresponding Setpoint temperature without subtracting off the Deadband Temperature Difference.
```
	
##  Field: Heater 2 Capacity

```
	
##  Field: Off-Cycle Parasitic Heat Fraction to Tank 
OffCycleParasiticHeatFractionToTank
```
The fraction of off-cycle parasitic fuel energy that is converted to heat energy that ends up in the tank water. For example, a pilot light would deliver most of its heat to the tank water, as long as the thermal conversion efficiency must be taken into account, so perhaps 0.80 is reasonable. Electronic control circuits, on the other hand, do not add any heat to the tank and should be 0.

```
	
##  Field: On-Cycle Parasitic Fuel Type 
OnCycleParasiticFuelType
```
The type of fuel used by the on-cycle parasitics. The fuel type can be Electricity, NaturalGas, Propane, FuelOilNo1, FuelOilNo2, Coal, Diesel, Gasoline, Steam, OtherFuel1, OtherFuel2 or {DistrictHeating}. The fuel type can be the same or different from the Heater Fuel Type.
```
	
##  Field: On-Cycle Parasitic Heat Fraction to Tank 
OnCycleParasiticHeatFractionToTank
```
The fraction of on-cycle parasitic fuel energy that is converted to heat energy that ends up in the tank water. For example, an induction fan might (maybe) deliver a small fraction of its energy to the tank water for a value of 0.05.

```
	
##  Field: Source Side Flow Control Mode 
SourceSideFlowControlMode
```
This field is optional and is used to provide control over the logic used by the source side of the water heater to request flow. There are three choices for different modes: IndirectHeatPrimarySetpoint, IndirectHeatAlternateSetpoint, or StorageTank.~~~ The mode called IndirectHeatPrimarySetpoint is the historical behavior prior to version 8.1.~ In this mode the water heater will request flow at the source side when the main setpoint, in the input field called Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name, and deadband call for the tank to be heated.~ This mode is typical for a water heater indirectly heated by a boiler.~ The mode called IndirectHeatAlternateSetpoint is similar but it bases its control decisions on an alternate setpoint given in the following field.~ This mode is useful when the indirect source of heat may not satisfy the load and an internal heater is used for backup.~ The mode called StorageTank is for a passive tank and it always requests flow unless the tank temperature is equal to or higher than the maximum limit given in the input field called Maximum Temperature Limit.

# WaterHeaterSizing

`WaterHeater:Sizing`
```
The WaterHeater:Sizing object is used to provide additional input data needed for designing tank volume and/or heater capacity for either the Mixed or Stratified water heaters.~ This object is only needed if volume or capacity is being automatically sized.~ There are no output variable associated with this object --~ sizing results are reported to the EIO output file and some predefined summary reports.
A source of design input data for use with this object can be found in the current ASHRAE Handbook HVAC Applications chapter on Service Water Heating.
```

##  Field: WaterHeater Name 
WaterHeaterName
```
This field contains the unique name of the water heater being sized.~ This name should match the name of a Water Heater:Mixed or a Water Heater:Stratified input object defined elsewhere in the input file.
```
	
##  Field: Design Mode 
DesignMode
```
This field describes which of several methods are to be used for sizing the water heater.~ There are six possible choices and one of the following should be selected:
  {PeakDraw}. This design method uses the design flow rates of all the different demands placed on the water heater.~ The tank size is based on how long it can meet the demand and how quickly it can recover.~ The user enters the time in hours that the water heater can meet the demands.~ Only the hot water uses connected to an individual water heater, or scheduled in the water heater object for stand-alone units, are included in that water heater's peak draw.
  {ResidentialHUD-FHAMinimum} This design method is based on minimum permissible water heater sizes (established by HUD-FHA in its Minimum Property Standards for One- and Two-Family Living Units, No. 4900.1-1982).~ The user enters the number of bathrooms and bedrooms in this input object.~ The smallest allowable water heater sizes are used.
  {PerPerson} This design method scales sizes based on the total number of people in all zones in the building.~ Each water heater in the model will be sized using the total (peak, design) number of people for the entire model.~ The number of people is determined from {People} objects defined elsewhere in the input file
  {PerFloorArea} This design method scales sizes based on the total floor area in all the zones in the building.~ Each water heater in the model will be sized using all the floor area in the model.~ The floor areas are determined from the geometry input elsewhere in the input file.
  {PerUnit} This design method scales sizes based on an arbitrary number of units.~ This can be used, for example, to size based on the number of rooms in a lodging building.~ The user provides the number of units in an input field in this object.
  {PerSolarCollectorArea} This design method scales tank volume based on the collector area for a solar hot water collector.~ The collector area is summed for all the collectors in the model and each tank is sized for the total.~ The collector area is determined from input for Solar Collectors defined elsewhere in the input file.
```
	
##  Field: Time Storage Can Meet Peak Draw 
TimeStorageCanMeetPeakDraw
```
This field provides the time, in hours, that the tank's volume can sustain a peak draw.~ It is used to size the tank's volume which is the simple product of peak draw volume flow rate and the draw time.~ There is no assurance that the water will be at the desired temperature for the entire draw.~ This field is only used if the Design Mode is ``{PeakDraw}.'' For a water heater connected to a full plant loop, it should be on the supply side and the plant loop needs a Plant Sizing object and the draw rate is the Use side design flow rate. For a stand-alone water heater, the draw rate is the maximum scheduled peak use flow rate.
```
	
##  Field: Time for Tank Recovery 
TimeForTankRecovery
```
This field provides the the time, in hours, that tank's heater needs to recover the volume of the tank. The temperatures used to define recovery are a starting temperature of 14.4°C (58°F) and a final temperature of 57.2°C (135°F). This field is only used if the Design Mode is ``{PeakDraw}.''
```
	
##  Field: Nominal Tank Volume for Autosizing Plant Connections 
NominalTankVolumeForAutosizingPlantConnections
```
This field is used in case the water heater is indirectly heated by its source side connections and they are also autosized.~ Because of the complexity of such a water heater and the timing for when sizing calculation happen inside EnergyPlus, the Source side connection flow rates need to be reported before the tank's volume can be sized to meet Peak Draw.~ This input field is used to provide a nominal tank volume to use temporarily while the flow connections are sized.~ This field is only used if the Design Mode is ``{PeakDraw}'' and the water heater has autosized plant connections on the demand side.
```
	
##  Field: Number of Bedrooms 
NumberOfBedrooms
```
This field is used to enter the numer of bedrooms in the model.~ This field is only used if the Design Mode is ``{ResidentialHUD-FHAMinimum}.''
```
	
##  Field: Number of Bathrooms

```
	
##  Field: Recovery Capacity per Person 
RecoveryCapacityPerPerson
```
This field is used to enter the recovery capacity per person in units of m^{3}/person/hr.~ This is the volume of water the heater can recover in one hour per person.~ Recovery is heating water from a starting temperature of 14.4°C (58°F) to a final temperature of 57.2°C (135°F).~ This field is only used if the Design Mode is ``{PerPerson}.''
```
	
##  Field: Storage Capacity per Floor Area 
StorageCapacityPerFloorArea
```
This field is used to enter the tank's storage volume on a per-floor-area basis.~ The units are m^{3} /m^{2} (water/floor area).~ This field is only used if the Design Mode is ``{PerFloorArea}.''
```
	
##  Field: Recovery Capacity per Floor Area 
RecoveryCapacityPerFloorArea
```
This field is used to enter the recovery capacity per floor area in units of m^{3}/m^{2}/hr.~ This is the volume water the heater can recover in an hour per floor area.~ Recovery is heating water from a starting temperature of 14.4°C (58°F) to a final temperature of 57.2°C (135°F).~ This field is only used if the Design Mode is ``{PerFloorArea}.''
```
	
##  Field: Number of Units 
NumberOfUnits
```

# WaterHeaterHeatPumpPumpedCondenser

`WaterHeater:HeatPump:PumpedCondenser`
```
The heat pump water heater with pumped condenser (HPWH) is a compound object consisting of a water heater tank (e.g., {\lstinline!WaterHeater:Mixed!} or {\lstinline!WaterHeater:Stratified!}), a direct expansion (DX) ``coil'' (i.e., an air-to-water DX compression system which includes a water heating coil, air coil, compressor, and water pump), and a fan to provide air flow across the air coil associated with the DX compression system. These objects work together to model a system which heats water using zone air, outdoor air, or a combination of zone and outdoor air as the primary heat source. Numerous configurations of tank location, inlet air source, and DX coil compressor location can be modeled, with one common configuration shown below.
In this model, the heat pump water heater's DX coil is considered the primary heat source and the water tank's heater (element or burner) provides supplemental heat as necessary. The model also assumes that the heat pump's fan and water pump cycle on and off with the compressor.
To model a heat pump water heater, the input data file must include some combination of the following objects depending on the configuration to be modeled:
  \lstinline!WaterHeater:HeatPump:PumpedCondenser! (required)
   {\lstinline!WaterHeater:Mixed!} or {\lstinline!WaterHeater:Stratified!} (required)
  {\lstinline!Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Pumped!} or {\lstinline!Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:VariableSpeed!} (required)
  {\lstinline!Fan:SystemModel!} or {\lstinline!Fan:OnOff!} (required)
  {\lstinline!ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList!} (when the HPWH draws some or all of its air from the zone, the heat pump water heater type and name must be in this list)
  {\lstinline!ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections!} (when the HPWH draws some or all of its air from the zone, the HPWH air inlet and outlet node names must be provided in this object)
  {\lstinline!OutdoorAir:NodeList!} (for HPWHs that use outdoor air as all or part of the heat source, the HPWH outdoor air node name must be provided in this list)
The input fields for the compound object are described in detail below:
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field contains a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a heat pump water heater. Any reference to this heat pump water heater by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the heat pump compressor is available to operate during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the heat pump compressor is off for that time period. A value other than 0 denotes that the heat pump compressor is available to operate during that time period. During times when the heat pump compressor is scheduled off, the heater (element or burner) in the water tank object operates based on its tank set point temperature schedule and the heat pump's parasitic electric power is also off for that time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Compressor Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name 
CompressorSetpointTemperatureScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that specifies the set point (or ``cut-out'') temperature for the heat pump compressor. Temperature values used in this schedule should be in degrees Celsius. The heat pump compressor cycles off when the tank water reaches this set point temperature. Once the heat pump compressor cycles off, the tank water temperature floats downward until it falls below the set point temperature minus the dead band temperature difference defined below (i.e., the ``cut-in'' temperature). At this point, the heat pump compressor cycles on and remains on until the heat pump compressor set point temperature is reached.
```
	
##  Field: Dead Band Temperature Difference 
DeadBandTemperatureDifference
```
This numeric field contains the dead band temperature difference in degrees Celsius. The heat pump compressor ``cut-in'' temperature is defined as the compressor set point temperature defined above minus this dead band temperature difference. The heat pump compressor cycles on when the water temperature in the tank falls below the ``cut-in'' temperature. The heat pump compressor remains on until the water temperature in the tank rises above the compressor set point (``cut-out'') temperature defined above. The dead band temperature difference must be greater than 0°C and less than or equal to 20°C. If this field is left blank, the default value is 5°C.
In this model, the heat pump water heater's DX compression system is considered the primary heat source and the water tank's heater (element or burner) provides supplemental heat as necessary. Therefore, the cut-in temperature for the heat pump compressor (set point minus dead band temperature difference) is usually higher than the set point temperature for the heater (element or burner) in the associated water heater tank object. At times when the water heater tank set point temperature is greater than the cut-in temperature of the heat pump compressor, the heat pump compressor is disabled and the tank's heater is used to heat the water.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Water Inlet Node Name 
CondenserWaterInletNodeName

```
	
##  Field: Condenser Water Outlet Node Name 
CondenserWaterOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the outlet water node for the heat pump's water heating coil (condenser). This node name must also be specified in the water heater tank object as the source inlet node name, and in the DX coil object as the condenser water outlet node name.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Water Flow Rate 
CondenserWaterFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the heat pump's condenser water flow rate in cubic meters per second. It is the actual condenser water flow rate to be simulated, which may differ from the rated condenser water volumetric flow rate specified for the heat pump's DX coil (Ref. Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump). This water flow rate must be greater than 0 or this field is autocalculatable. If autocalculated (field value = {autocalculate}), the condenser water flow rate is set equal to the rated heating capacity of the heat pump's DX coil multiplied by 4.487E-8 m^{3}/s/W. When this flow rate is different from the Rated Condenser Water Volumetric Flow Rate specified in the heat pump's DX coil object (Ref. Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump), the user should also specify a Total Heating Capacity Modifier Curve Name (function of water flow fraction) and a Heating COP Modifier Curve Name (function of water flow fraction) in the associated DX coil object to account for differences in capacity and power consumption at the off-rated water flow rate.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporator Air Flow Rate 
EvaporatorAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the air flow rate across the heat pump's air coil (evaporator) in cubic meters per second. It is the actual air flow rate to be simulated, which may differ from the rated evaporator air volumetric flow rate specified for the heat pump's DX coil (Ref. {Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Pumped}). Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autocalculatable. If autocalculated (field value = {autocalculate}), the evaporator air flow rate is set equal to the rated heating capacity of the heat pump's DX coil multiplied by 5.035E-5 m^{3}/s/W. When this flow rate is different from the Rated Evaporator Air Volumetric Flow Rate specified in the heat pump's DX coil object (Ref. {Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Pumped}), the user should also specify a Total Heating Capacity Modifier Curve Name (function of air flow fraction) and a Heating COP Modifier Curve Name (function of air flow fraction) in the associated DX coil object to account for differences in capacity and power consumption at the off-rated air flow rate.
```

```
	
##  Field: On Cycle Parasitic Electric Load 
OnCycleParasiticElectricLoad
```
This numeric field contains the on-cycle parasitic electric power in Watts. This is the parasitic electric power consumed by controls or other electrical devices associated with the heat pump water heater. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the heat pump compressor is operating and the model assumes that this parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water. This parasitic load does, however, affect the zone air heat balance when the heat pump water heater sends some or all of its outlet air to a zone (i.e., Inlet Air Configuration field specified as `ZoneAirOnly' or `ZoneAndOutdoorAir') and the Parasitic Heat Rejection Location field is specified as `Zone'. The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Off Cycle Parasitic Electric Load 
OffCycleParasiticElectricLoad
```
This numeric field contains the off-cycle parasitic electric power in Watts. This is the parasitic electric power consumed by controls or other electrical devices associated with the heat pump compressor. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the heat pump water heater is available but the compressor is not operating, and the model assumes that this parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water. This parasitic load does, however, affect the zone air heat balance when the heat pump water heater sends some or all of its outlet air to a zone (i.e., Inlet Air Configuration field specified as `ZoneAirOnly' or `ZoneAndOutdoorAir') and the Parasitic Heat Rejection Location field is specified as `Zone'.

```
This alpha (choice) field determines where the on-cycle and off-cycle parasitic heat is rejected. Valid choices are Zone and Exterior. If `Zone' is selected, both the on-cycle and off-cycle parasitic heat is rejected to the zone defined in the field Inlet Air Zone Name, and the Inlet Air Configuration must be `ZoneAirOnly' or `ZoneAndOutdoorAir. If 'Outdoors' is selected, this parasitic heat is rejected outdoors (does not impact the zone air heat balance) regardless of the specified Inlet Air Configuration. If this field is left blank, the default value is 'Outdoors'.
```
	
##  Field: Inlet Air Mixer Node Name 
InletAirMixerNodeName
```
This optional alpha field defines the name of the HVAC node which represents the mixture of outdoor air and zone air that enters the heat pump air coil (evaporator) and fan section. The model mixes outdoor air with zone air and places the result on this inlet air mixer node based on the Inlet Air Mixer Schedule defined below. When the schedule value is equal to 0, 100% zone air enters the evaporator coil and fan section of the heat pump water heater. When the schedule value is equal to 1, 100% outdoor air enters the evaporator coil and fan section. This node name must be provided if the Inlet Air Configuration field above is specified as `ZoneAndOutdoor Air', otherwise this field should be left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Outlet Air Splitter Node Name 
OutletAirSplitterNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the air node to which the heat pump air coil (evaporator) and fan sends all of its outlet air. The supply air flow downstream of this node is split between the zone and outdoors based on the Inlet Air Mixer schedule defined below. When the schedule value is equal to 0, the entire outlet air stream is diverted to the zone. When the schedule value is equal to 1, the entire outlet air stream is exhausted to outdoors. This node name must be provided if the Inlet Air Configuration field above is specified as `Zone and Outdoor Air', otherwise this field should be left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Inlet Air Mixer Schedule Name 
InletAirMixerScheduleName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the heat pump draws its inlet air from the zone, outdoors, or a combination of zone and outdoor air. A schedule value equal to 0 indicates that the heat pump draws its inlet air from the zone. A schedule value equal to 1 denotes that the heat pump draws its inlet air from outdoors. Values between 0 and 1 denote a mixture of zone and outdoor air proportional to the schedule value. The Inlet Air Mixer schedule controls both the inlet air mixer and outlet air splitter nodes in unison to ensure that the operation of the heat pump does not contribute to zone pressurization or depressurization. For example if the Inlet Air Mixer schedule value is 0.4, then the inlet air mixer node is composed of 40% outdoor air and 60% zone air. For this same case, the outlet air splitter directs 60% of the HPWH outlet air back to the zone and 40% of the outlet air flow is exhausted outdoors. This schedule name must be provided if the Inlet Air Configuration field is specified as `Zone and Outdoor Air', otherwise this field should be left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Tank Element Control Logic 
TankElementControlLogic
```
This alpha field defines settings for the control logic of when to run the tank element in relation to whether the heat pump is running.
  {MutuallyExclusive} means that once the tank heating element(s) are active, the heat pump is shut down until the heating element setpoint is reached.
  {Simultaneous} (default) means that both the tank heating element and heat pump are used at the same time to recover the tank temperature.
```
	
##  Field: Control Sensor 1 Height In Stratified Tank 
ControlSensor1HeightInStratifiedTank
```
This alpha field defines where the tank temperature is sensed for heat pump control when the tank type is {\lstinline!WaterHeater:Stratified!}.~ The stratified tank model produces tank temperature at different nodes in the vertical direction and various options are available for how this temperature should be sensed to control the heat pump.~ This is measured in height from the bottom of the tank. Internally the appropriate node is determined based on this height. If omitted, this defaults to the height of Heater1.
```
	
##  Field: Control Sensor 1 Weight 
ControlSensor1Weight
```
The model can optionally use two control sensor locations in stratified tanks. When that is the case, the temperature sensed at each location is weighted. This alpha input specifies the weight associated with Control Sensor 1. It is input as a value between 0 and 1. The weight of Control Sensor 2 is determined by subtracting this weight from 1. The default for this field is 1, indicating that only Control Sensor 1 is used.
```
	
##  Field: Control Sensor 2 Height in Stratified Tank 
ControlSensor2HeightInStratifiedTank
```
This alpha field defines the optional second location where the tank temperature is sensed for heat pump control when the tank type is {\lstinline!WaterHeater:Stratified!}. If omitted, this defaults to the height of Heater2.

# WaterHeaterHeatPumpWrappedCondenser

`WaterHeater:HeatPump:WrappedCondenser`
```
The heat pump water heater with wrapped condenser is a compound object very similar to the {\lstinline!WaterHeater:HeatPump:PumpedCondenser!} object. It likewise combines a water heater tank, a direct expansion (DX) ``coil'', and a fan to provide air flow across the air coil associated with the DX compression system. The primary difference is that instead of pumping water through an external condenser, the heating coils are wrapped around or submerged in the tank. This type of HPWH is most common in packaged units meant for residential applications.
To model a wrapped condenser heat pump water, the input data file must include some combination of the following objects depending on the configuration to be modeled:
  \lstinline!WaterHeater:HeatPump:WrappedCondenser! (required)
  {\lstinline!WaterHeater:Stratified!} (required)
  {\lstinline!Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Wrapped!} (required)
  {Fan:SystemModel!} or {\lstinline!Fan:OnOff!} (required)
  {\lstinline!ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList!} (when the HPWH draws some or all of its air from the zone, the heat pump water heater type and name must be in this list)
  {\lstinline!ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections!} (when the HPWH draws some or all of its air from the zone, the HPWH air inlet and outlet node names must be provided in this object)
  {\lstinline!OutdoorAir:NodeList!} (for HPWHs that use outdoor air as all or part of the heat source, the HPWH outdoor air node name must be provided in this list)
The input fields for the compound object are described in detail below:
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field contains a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a heat pump water heater. Any reference to this heat pump water heater by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the heat pump compressor is available to operate during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the heat pump compressor is off for that time period. A value other than 0 denotes that the heat pump compressor is available to operate during that time period. During times when the heat pump compressor is scheduled off, the heater (element or burner) in the water tank object operates based on its tank set point temperature schedule and the heat pump's parasitic electric power is also off for that time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Compressor Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name 
CompressorSetpointTemperatureScheduleName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that specifies the set point (or ``cut-out'') temperature for the heat pump compressor. Temperature values used in this schedule should be in degrees Celsius. The heat pump compressor cycles off when the tank water reaches this set point temperature. Once the heat pump compressor cycles off, the tank water temperature floats downward until it falls below the set point temperature minus the dead band temperature difference defined below (i.e., the ``cut-in'' temperature). At this point, the heat pump compressor cycles on and remains on until the heat pump compressor set point temperature is reached.
```
	
##  Field: Dead Band Temperature Difference 
DeadBandTemperatureDifference
```
This numeric field contains the dead band temperature difference in degrees Celsius. The heat pump compressor ``cut-in'' temperature is defined as the compressor set point temperature defined above minus this dead band temperature difference. The heat pump compressor cycles on when the water temperature in the tank falls below the ``cut-in'' temperature. The heat pump compressor remains on until the water temperature in the tank rises above the compressor set point (``cut-out'') temperature defined above. The dead band temperature difference must be greater than 0°C and less than or equal to 20°C. If this field is left blank, the default value is 5°C.
In this model, the heat pump water heater's DX compression system is considered the primary heat source and the water tank's heater (element or burner) provides supplemental heat as necessary. Therefore, the cut-in temperature for the heat pump compressor (set point minus dead band temperature difference) is usually higher than the set point temperature for the heater (element or burner) in the associated water heater tank object. At times when the water heater tank set point temperature is greater than the cut-in temperature of the heat pump compressor, the heat pump compressor is disabled and the tank's heater is used to heat the water.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Bottom Location 
CondenserBottomLocation
```
This numeric field contains the distance from the bottom of the tank to the bottom of the wrapped condenser.
```
	
##  Field: Condenser Top Location 
CondenserTopLocation
```
This numeric field contains the distance from the bottom of the tank to the top of the wrapped condenser.
```
	
##  Field: Evaporator Air Flow Rate 
EvaporatorAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field contains the air flow rate across the heat pump's air coil (evaporator) in cubic meters per second. It is the actual air flow rate to be simulated, which may differ from the rated evaporator air volumetric flow rate specified for the heat pump's DX coil (Ref. {Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Wrapped}). Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autocalculatable. If autocalculated (field value = {autocalculate}), the evaporator air flow rate is set equal to the rated heating capacity of the heat pump's DX coil multiplied by 5.035E-5 m^{3}/s/W. When this flow rate is different from the Rated Evaporator Air Volumetric Flow Rate specified in the heat pump's DX coil object (Ref. {Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Wrapped}), the user should also specify a Total Heating Capacity Modifier Curve Name (function of air flow fraction) and a Heating COP Modifier Curve Name (function of air flow fraction) in the associated DX coil object to account for differences in capacity and power consumption at the off-rated air flow rate.
```
	
##  Field: Inlet Air Configuration 
InletAirConfiguration
```
This choice field defines the configuration of the air flow path through the heat pump air coil (evaporator) and fan section. Valid entries are {Schedule}, {ZoneAirOnly}, {OutdoorAirOnly}, or {ZoneAndOutdoorAir}. If `Schedule' is selected, names for an inlet air temperature schedule and an inlet air humidity schedule must be defined in the fields below. If `ZoneAirOnly' is selected, the corresponding zone name must be entered in the Inlet Air Zone Name field below. If `ZoneAndOutdoorAir' is selected, the corresponding Inlet Air Zone Name, Inlet Air Mixer Node Name, Outlet Air Splitter Node Name, and an Inlet Air Mixer Schedule Name must be entered in the corresponding fields below.
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the node from which the heat pump water heater draws its inlet air. If the Inlet Air Configuration field defined above is set to `ZoneAirOnly' or `ZoneAndOutdoorAir', then this node name should be the name of a zone air exhaust node (Ref. {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}). If the Inlet Air Configuration field is set to `OutdoorAirOnly', this node name should be left blank. If the Inlet Air Configuration field is set to `Schedule', this node name should simply be a unique name that allows the user to receive output on conditions at this node for verification purposes.
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName
```

```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Node Name 
OutdoorAirNodeName
```
This alpha field contains the name of the node from which the heat pump water heater draws its outdoor air.

```
	
##  Field: On Cycle Parasitic Electric Load 
OnCycleParasiticElectricLoad
```
This numeric field contains the on-cycle parasitic electric power in Watts. This is the parasitic electric power consumed by controls or other electrical devices associated with the heat pump water heater. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the heat pump compressor is operating and the model assumes that this parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water. This parasitic load does, however, affect the zone air heat balance when the heat pump water heater sends some or all of its outlet air to a zone (i.e., Inlet Air Configuration field specified as `ZoneAirOnly' or `ZoneAndOutdoorAir') and the Parasitic Heat Rejection Location field is specified as `Zone'. The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Off Cycle Parasitic Electric Load 
OffCycleParasiticElectricLoad
```
This numeric field contains the off-cycle parasitic electric power in Watts. This is the parasitic electric power consumed by controls or other electrical devices associated with the heat pump compressor. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the heat pump water heater is available but the compressor is not operating, and the model assumes that this parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water. This parasitic load does, however, affect the zone air heat balance when the heat pump water heater sends some or all of its outlet air to a zone (i.e., Inlet Air Configuration field specified as `ZoneAirOnly' or `ZoneAndOutdoorAir') and the Parasitic Heat Rejection Location field is specified as `Zone'. The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Parasitic Heat Rejection Location 
ParasiticHeatRejectionLocation
```
This alpha (choice) field determines where the on-cycle and off-cycle parasitic heat is rejected. Valid choices are Zone and Exterior. If `Zone' is selected, both the on-cycle and off-cycle parasitic heat is rejected to the zone defined in the field Inlet Air Zone Name, and the Inlet Air Configuration must be `ZoneAirOnly' or `ZoneAndOutdoorAir. If 'Outdoors' is selected, this parasitic heat is rejected outdoors (does not impact the zone air heat balance) regardless of the specified Inlet Air Configuration. If this field is left blank, the default value is 'Outdoors'.
```
	
##  Field: Inlet Air Mixer Node Name 
InletAirMixerNodeName
```
This optional alpha field defines the name of the HVAC node which represents the mixture of outdoor air and zone air that enters the heat pump air coil (evaporator) and fan section. The model mixes outdoor air with zone air and places the result on this inlet air mixer node based on the Inlet Air Mixer Schedule defined below. When the schedule value is equal to 0, 100% zone air enters the evaporator coil and fan section of the heat pump water heater. When the schedule value is equal to 1, 100% outdoor air enters the evaporator coil and fan section. This node name must be provided if the Inlet Air Configuration field above is specified as `ZoneAndOutdoor Air', otherwise this field should be left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Outlet Air Splitter Node Name 
OutletAirSplitterNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the air node to which the heat pump air coil (evaporator) and fan sends all of its outlet air. The supply air flow downstream of this node is split between the zone and outdoors based on the Inlet Air Mixer schedule defined below. When the schedule value is equal to 0, the entire outlet air stream is diverted to the zone. When the schedule value is equal to 1, the entire outlet air stream is exhausted to outdoors. This node name must be provided if the Inlet Air Configuration field above is specified as `Zone and Outdoor Air', otherwise this field should be left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Inlet Air Mixer Schedule Name 
InletAirMixerScheduleName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the heat pump draws its inlet air from the zone, outdoors, or a combination of zone and outdoor air. A schedule value equal to 0 indicates that the heat pump draws its inlet air from the zone. A schedule value equal to 1 denotes that the heat pump draws its inlet air from outdoors. Values between 0 and 1 denote a mixture of zone and outdoor air proportional to the schedule value. The Inlet Air Mixer schedule controls both the inlet air mixer and outlet air splitter nodes in unison to ensure that the operation of the heat pump does not contribute to zone pressurization or depressurization. For example if the Inlet Air Mixer schedule value is 0.4, then the inlet air mixer node is composed of 40% outdoor air and 60% zone air. For this same case, the outlet air splitter directs 60% of the HPWH outlet air back to the zone and 40% of the outlet air flow is exhausted outdoors. This schedule name must be provided if the Inlet Air Configuration field is specified as `Zone and Outdoor Air', otherwise this field should be left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Tank Element Control Logic 
TankElementControlLogic
```
This alpha field defines settings for the control logic of when to run the tank element in relation to whether the heat pump is running.
  {MutuallyExclusive} means that once the tank heating element(s) are active, the heat pump is shut down until the heating element setpoint is reached.
  {Simultaneous} (default) means that both the tank heating element and heat pump are used at the same time to recover the tank temperature.
```
	
##  Field: Control Sensor 1 Height In Stratified Tank 
ControlSensor1HeightInStratifiedTank
```
This alpha field defines where the tank temperature is sensed for heat pump control when the tank type is {\lstinline!WaterHeater:Stratified!}.~ The stratified tank model produces tank temperature at different nodes in the vertical direction and various options are available for how this temperature should be sensed to control the heat pump.~ This is measured in height from the bottom of the tank. Internally the appropriate node is determined based on this height. If omitted, this defaults to the height of Heater1.
```
	
##  Field: Control Sensor 1 Weight 
ControlSensor1Weight
```
The model can optionally use two control sensor locations in stratified tanks. When that is the case, the temperature sensed at each location is weighted. This alpha input specifies the weight associated with Control Sensor 1. It is input as a value between 0 and 1. The weight of Control Sensor 2 is determined by subtracting this weight from 1. The default for this field is 1, indicating that only Control Sensor 1 is used.
```
	
##  Field: Control Sensor 2 Height in Stratified Tank 
ControlSensor2HeightInStratifiedTank
```
This alpha field defines the optional second location where the tank temperature is sensed for heat pump control when the tank type is {\lstinline!WaterHeater:Stratified!}. If omitted, this defaults to the height of Heater2.
Following is an example input for the \lstinline!WaterHeater:HeatPump:WrappedCondenser! compound object and the other required component objects that it references.

# ColdThermalStorageObjects

`Cold Thermal Storage Objects`
```
There are four types of cold thermal storage objects that can be added to plant loops. (To model cold thermal storage integrated with packaged air-conditioning units, see the thermal storage cooling coil in section {coilcoolingdxsinglespeedthermalstorage}.  The four cold thermal storage objects for plant loops are:
  {ThermalStorage:Ice:Simple}
  {ThermalStorage:Ice:Detailed}
  {ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Mixed}
  {ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Stratified}
These objects are typically placed on the supply side of a primary chilled water loop in series or in parallel with one or more chillers.~ Using the the component set point ({PlantEquipmentOperation:ComponentSetpoint}) plant operation scheme type, the chiller and storage tank setpoints are used to control operation. Using a {SetpointManager:Scheduled} object (or other appropriate type of set point manager), the setpoints on the chiller outlet node and the ice storage outlet node can be used to control how the cooling load is shared and when charging of storage occurs.~ Example setpoints to use for various modes of operation are shown in the table below:
Example files have been developed for three common storage configurations:
1.~Series -- Chiller Upstream:~ In this configuration, a chiller is placed first on the same branch as the storage unit.
2.~Series -- Chiller Downstream:~ In this configuration, a chiller is placed second on the same branch as the storage unit.
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
  Parallel:~ In this configuration, the chiller is on a branch parallel to the storage unit branch when it is not charging.~ During charging mode, valves will be changed so that the chiller is in series upstream of the storage.~ To accomplish this in EnergyPlus, the chiller must be modeled using two different chiller objects to represent the same chiller.~ One chiller object on a parallel branch operates only when storage is not being charged.~ The other chiller object, in series upstream of the storage unit operates only during charging mode.
Other considerations for applying cold thermal storage objects include:
  In the {PlantLoop} object, the ``Minimum Loop Temperature'' must be set equal to or less than the lowest setpoint to be used anywhere in the loop.
  To end the storage charging cycle, use a {AvailabilityManager:LowTemperatureTurnOff} to shut off the primary chilled water loop when the temperature leaving the storage tank nears the charging mode chiller setpoint indicating that the tank is fully charged.~ For example, if the chiller is set to provide --5C chilled water during charging, then charging can be shut down when the water temperature leaving the storage unit reaches --4C.~ When using a primary-secondary loop arrangement, it may be necessary to schedule this availability manager to be active only when the HVAC systems are off to avoid fighting between the demand controls and the availability manager.
```

# ThermalStorageIceSimple

`ThermalStorage:Ice:Simple`
```
This thermal storage model is based on a simple simulation of an ice storage tank with a fixed capacity.~ The tank is charged, or frozen, in an ice-on-coil configuration where ice builds up on the outside of the tubes carrying the brine or glycol solution from the chiller.~ There are two discharge (melt) options, internal or external.~ Internal melt uses the same fluid tubes for charging and discharging.~ External melt uses a separate fluid path for discharge such that the outer layers of ice melt first.~ The ice storage model includes an implied 3-way valve to control the amount of charge/discharge based on the incoming water temperature and the outlet node setpoint temperature.~ The storage tank is assumed to be fully charged (full of ice) at the beginning of each environment.~ The tank is then allowed to charge and discharge during the warmup days of the environment.~ The tank is best controlled using the {PlantEquipmentOperation:ComponentSetpoint} plant operation scheme, and requires that a setpoint be placed by a set point manager on the ice storage Plant Outlet Node.
The input fields for the object are described in detail below:
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the ice storage tank.
```
	
##  Field: Ice Storage Type 
IceStorageType

```
	
# ThermalStorageIceDetailed

`ThermalStorage:Ice:Detailed`
```
The detailed ice storage model allows the users of EnergyPlus to model more closely specific manufacturers' ice storage units. This is possible due to the use of curve fits to simulate the performance of the ice storage unit during charging and discharging. In this implementation, both charging and discharging are a function of the fraction charged/discharged as well as the log mean temperature difference across the storage unit. More information on the model is provided in the Engineering Reference for EnergyPlus. The remainder of this section describes the input required for the detailed ice storage model and the output that it can produce.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This field is the name of the detailed ice storage system given to it by the user.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This field is the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that determines whether or not the ice storage system is available during a particular time period. This allows the system to be turned off during a particular season. A value of less than or equal to zero indicates that the ice storage system is not available. Any value greater than zero indicates that the system is available. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Capacity 
Capacity
```
This number is the maximum amount of latent thermal storage available in the ice storage system. This model does not allow the removal or addition of sensible energy from the tank. Thus, it is always assumed to be at the freezing temperature of the storage material. The capacity is expressed in units of GJ.
```
	
##  Field: Inlet Node Name 
InletNodeName
```
This is the name of the node that connects the ice storage system to the plant loop. It is the inlet node to the ice storage component. The next field defines the outlet node. Due to presence of an internal bypass in this model, there are other ``nodes'' that are handled internally within the program. Users do not need to define any nodes other than the inlet and outlet nodes.
```
	
##  Field: Outlet Node Name 
OutletNodeName
```
This is the name of the other node that connects the ice storage system to the plant loop. It is the outlet node to the ice storage component.
```
	
##  Field: Discharging Curve Variable Specifications 
DischargingCurveVariableSpecifications
```
The detailed ice storage model in EnergyPlus takes advantage of the Curve feature of the program.  The discharging curve can use any curve that has two independent variables.  This field controls which two parameters are the independent variables in modeling the performance of the detailed ice storage model during discharging. There are four different independent variable specifications:
FractionChargedLMTD (where Fraction Charged is the first independent variable and LMTD is the second independent variable)
 
FractionDischargedLMTD (where Fraction Discharged is the first independent variable and LMTD is the second independent variable)
LMTDMassFlow (where LMTD is the first independent variable and Mass Flow rate is the second independent variable)
LMTDFractionCharged (where LMTD is the first independent variable and Fraction Charged is the second independent variable)
More information on curve types can be found in the section on Curves.  For additional information on how these curves are used in the Detailed Ice Storage model, please consult the Engineering Reference.
```
	
##  Field: Discharging Curve Name 
DischargingCurveName
```
This field specifies the name of the actual curve fit to be used to model the discharging process of the detailed ice storage system. Note that this must be a curve that has two independent variables.
```
	
##  Field: Charging Curve Variable Specifications 
ChargingCurveVariableSpecifications
```
The detailed ice storage model in EnergyPlus takes advantage of the Curve feature of the program.  The charging curve can use any curve that has two independent variables.  This field controls which two parameters are the independent variables in modeling the performance of the detailed ice storage model during charging. There are four different independent variable specifications:
FractionChargedLMTD (where Fraction Charged is the first independent variable and LMTD is the second independent variable)
 
FractionDischargedLMTD (where Fraction Discharged is the first independent variable and LMTD is the second independent variable)

LMTDFractionCharged (where LMTD is the first independent variable and Fraction Charged is the second independent variable)
More information on curve types can be found in the section on Curves.  For additional information on how these curves are used in the Detailed Ice Storage model, please consult the Engineering Reference.
```
	
##  Field: Charging Curve Name 
ChargingCurveName
```
This field specifies the name of the actual curve fit to be used to model the charging process of the detailed ice storage system. Note that this must be a curve that has two independent variables.
```
	
##  Field: Timestep of the Curve Data 
TimestepOfTheCurveData
```
This field defines what timestep was used to produce the curve fits named in the previous inputs. This parameter is important because the curve fit is non-dimensional. Thus, the data used to develop the curve fits were based on a specific length of time. In many cases, this is probably one hour or 1.0. The units for this parameter are hours.
```
	
##  Field: Parasitic Electric Load During Discharging 
ParasiticElectricLoadDuringDischarging
```
This field defines the amount of parasitic electric consumption (for controls or other miscellaneous electric consumption associate with the ice storage unit itself) during the discharge phase. This parameter is dimensionless and gets multiplied by the current load on the tank.
```
	
##  Field: Parasitic Electric Load During Charging 
ParasiticElectricLoadDuringCharging
```
This field defines the amount of parasitic electric consumption (for controls or other miscellaneous electric consumption associate with the ice storage unit itself) during the charge phase. This parameter is dimensionless and gets multiplied by the current load on the tank.
```
	
##  Field: Tank Loss Coefficient 
TankLossCoefficient
```
This field defines the loss of ice stored during a particular hour. This field is dimensionless (per hour). It is not multiplied by any temperature difference between the tank and the environment in which it might be located.
```
	
##  Field: Freezing Temperature of Storage Medium 
FreezingTemperatureOfStorageMedium
```
This parameter defines the freezing/melting temperature of the ice storage medium in degrees Celsius. For most tanks, this is simply 0.0°C (the default value). However, some tanks may use other materials or salts which would change the freezing temperature. This can be changed using this parameter.
```
	
##  Field: Thaw Process Indicator 
ThawProcessIndicator
```
This input field assists in more accurate modeling of the charging process by defining how the thawing of ice takes place. There are two options for this input: {InsideMelt} and {OutsideMelt}. Some ice storage systems, by their nature, start the charging process with a bare coil or no ice left on the charging surface even though there is still ice stored in the tank.~ An example of such a system is sometimes referred to as an ice-on-coil inside melt system, and these systems would define this parameter using the ``InsideMelt'' option for this field.~ Other systems melt the ice from the outside, leaving ice still on the charging surface when charging begins. These systems are modeled using the ``OutsideMelt'' option.~ For systems that have a charging process that does not vary significantly with fraction charged can ignore this input by accepting the default value.~ The default value for this field is ``OutsideMelt''.

# ThermalStorageChilledWaterMixed

`ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Mixed`
```
The ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Mixed object analytically solves the differential equation governing the energy balance of the water tank.~ The chilled water is ``used'' by drawing from the ``Use Side'' of the water tank.~ The tank is indirectly charged by circulating cold water through the ``Source Side'' of the water tank.
Control is based on cycling flow through the source side.~ When the tank temperature rises above a ``cut-in'' temperature, source side flow is requested.~ Source side flow will continue until the tank is cooled to below the tank set point or ``cut-out'' temperature.
For heat gains from the ambient environment, the ambient air temperature can be taken from a schedule, a zone, or the exterior. When used with a zone, the skin gains are removed from the zone heat balance as negative internal heat gains.

```
	
##  Field: Nominal Cooling Capacity 
NominalCoolingCapacity
```
This field describes the typical cooling capacity that the chilled water tank will provide.~ Since this is a passive device, the actual cooling capacity depends on water temperatures and flow rates.~ However, this field is used to describe the chilled water tank's nominal cooling capacity for supervisory control where plant operation schemes require a cooling capacity to model how equipment is dispatched.
```
	
##  Field: Ambient Temperature Indicator 
AmbientTemperatureIndicator
```
The Ambient Temperature Indicator specifies how the ambient air temperature will be indicated. The field can be ``Schedule'', ``Zone'', or ``Exterior.'' If {Schedule} is used, the Ambient Temperature Schedule Name field provides the values for ambient temperature. If {Zone} is used, the zone air temperature of the zone specified in the Ambient Temperature Zone field provides the ambient temperature. If {Exterior} is used, the outdoor dry-bulb air temperature provides the ambient temperature.
```
	
##  Field: Ambient Temperature Schedule Name 
AmbientTemperatureScheduleName

This field is applicable only when the Ambient Temperature Indicator is specified as {Exterior}, otherwise this field should be left blank. The node name specified must also be specified in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air conditions from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an {OutdoorAir:NodeList} object where the outdoor air conditions are taken directly from the weather data.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Gain Coefficient from Ambient Temperature 
HeatGainCoefficientFromAmbientTemperature
```
The gain coefficient [W/K] from the ambient air temperature. This coefficient is often referred to as the ``UA'' for the overall tank thermal performance with respect to heat gains from the tank's skin..

# ThermalStorageChilledWaterStratified

`ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Stratified`
```
The ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Stratified object divides the water tank into multiple nodes of equal volume. The nodes are coupled by vertical conduction effects, internode fluid flow, and temperature inversion mixing. The object simultaneously solves the differential equations governing the energy balances on the nodes using a numerical method. The system timestep is divided into many small substeps that allow the simulation to capture events that occur on a very short time scale.~ The chilled water is ``used'' by drawing from the ``Use Side'' of the water tank.~ The tank is indirectly charged by circulating cold water through the ``Source Side'' of the water tank.
Control is based on cycling flow through the source side.~ When the tank temperature rises above a ``cut-in'' temperature, source side flow is requested.~ Source side flow will continue until the tank is cooled to below the tank set point or ``cut-out'' temperature.
For heat gains from the ambient environment, the ambient air temperature can be taken from a schedule, a zone, or the exterior. When used with a zone, the skin gains are removed from the zone heat balance as negative internal heat gains.

# WaterUseEquipment

`WaterUse:Equipment`
```
The WaterUse:Equipment object is a generalized object for simulating all water end uses. Hot and cold water uses are included, as well as controlled mixing of hot and cold water at the tap. The WaterUse:Equipment object can be used stand-alone, or coupled into a plant loop using the {WaterUse:Connections} object (see below). The {WaterUse:Connections} object allows water uses to be linked to {WaterUse:Storage} objects to store and draw reclaimed water. The {WaterUse:Connections} object can also simulate drainwater heat recovery.
The WaterUse:Equipment object serves all of the same purposes as the existing objects: {Exterior:WaterEquipment}, and {HotWaterEquipment}.
The WaterUse:Equipment object does a better job of modeling domestic hot water by allowing mixing at the tap in order to account for both hot {and cold} water used at sinks, showers, etc. It also improves on the stand-alone energy modeling of domestic hot water. Because all of the temperatures and flow rates can be solved, the energy usage can be accounted for as ``Purchased Heating''.
In either stand-alone mode or used with the {WaterUse:Connections} object, the WaterUse:Equipment object will attempt to meet a scheduled target temperature at the tap by mixing hot and cold water flows. If the hot water flow is not hot enough, or if the flow is limited by plant loop constraints, the result is a cooler mixed water temperature and the target temperature will not be met. In stand-alone mode the hot and cold water temperatures are specified by schedules. However, if the cold water schedule is omitted, the water temperature will be calculated by the {Site:WaterMainsTemperature} object. If the hot water schedule or target temperature schedule are omitted, all water is delivered as cold water. If only using cold water, the WaterUse:Equipment object is similar to the {Exterior:WaterEquipment} object.
The WaterUse:Equipment object improves on the internal gains object {HotWaterEquipment} by associating actual water usage with a sensible and latent gain to a zone. Equipment, such as showers, that generate a significant heat gain can be modeled using the Sensible Fraction Schedule and Latent Fraction Schedule fields. The schedules are used to set the fraction of the maximum possible heat gain (based on inlet water conditions and ambient zone conditions) that should be added to the zone. The split between sensible and latent will vary depending on the type of equipment that is to be modeled. Typically, both fractions should be small numbers.

The WaterUse:Connections object can be thought of as a subsystem that groups together multiple {WaterUse:Equipment} components. As its name suggests, the object provides connections that are shared by these components, including:
  Inlet node and outlet node connections to a plant loop
  Connections to {WaterUse:Storage} objects to store and draw reclaimed water
  Internal connections to simulate drainwater heat recovery.
The WaterUse:Connections object can be used stand-alone or coupled into a plant loop. In stand-alone mode, the Hot and Cold Water Supply Temperature Schedules override the values for the listed {WaterUse:Equipment} objects. When coupled to the plant, the Hot Water Supply Temperature Schedule is overridden by the actual plant loop inlet water temperature. When coupled to the plant, the WaterUse:Connections object should be on a {Branch} object whose control type is set to Active.

One popular type of drainwater heat exchanger is the Gravity-Film Heat Exchanger (GFX). The GFX is most closely approximated with the CounterFlow option, but keep in mind that the UA varies more with flow rate for the GFX than for most traditional heat exchangers.
```
	
##  Field: Drain Water Heat Exchanger Destination 
DrainWaterHeatExchangerDestination
```
The heat exchanger configuration to be used for drainwater heat recovery. The configuration determines where the heat will be used after it is recovered.
Plant indicates that the all of the recovered heat will be sent to the return flow at the outlet node of the WaterUse:Connections object to preheat the make-up cold water from the water mains.
Equipment indicates that the all of the recovered heat will be used to preheat the cold water flow side of the {WaterUse:Equipment} objects listed {in this} WaterUse:Connections object
PlantAndEquipment indicates the recovered heat will be divided between the plant and the {WaterUse:Equipment} objects, as described above. This is the only option where the flow rates are equal in the drain and the heat exchanger.
```
	
##  Field: Drain Water Heat Exchanger U-Factor Times Area

# WaterUseStorage

`WaterUse:Storage`
```
The WaterUse:Storage object is a central component for complex water systems. This object is not needed if the only use of water is directly from the mains, or utility service water. If the building model is to include any on-site collection or wells or storing and reuse of graywater, then a WaterUse:Storage is needed. Each WaterUse:Storage can serve as a central node and make connections to numerous sources of supply or numerous components with demand. If a maximum capacity is not specified, the tank is assumed to have unlimited capacity. This is useful for sizing.
Storage tanks may handle a lot of water but show no use. This is because water usage is metered at the component level were water is used up. The only water a storage tank might use up is overflow water if it is discarded.

# WaterUseRainCollector

`WaterUse:RainCollector`
```
The WaterUse:RainCollector object is used for harvesting rainwater falling on building surfaces. The rainwater is sent to a {WaterUse:Storage} object. Up till version 9.6, in order to use this object, it is necessary to also include a {Site:Precipitation} object to describe the rates of rainfall. For newer versions, if the {Site:Precipitation} object is not defined, precipitation depth in the weather input .epw will be used instead. When this is the case, a warning message will be displayed. Please make sure the precipitation in the .epw is accurate. This \href{table by the State Climate Extreme Committee}{https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/records/all/maxp} could be a reference for sanity check of extreme values in the precipitation data. The tabular report ``Monthly Precipitation Summary'' provides a monthly summary of rainfall in the weather file and the amount used in the rain collector calculation.

# WaterUseWell

`WaterUse:Well`
```
The WaterUse:Well object is for simulating on-site water supply from a well. Well water is pumped out of the ground and into a {WaterUse:Storage}. The operation of the ground water well is controlled by the associated {WaterUse:Storage} which is assumed to be operated as a vented cistern with no pressure tank. The current implementation is very simple and only requires two numeric inputs: the rated pump flow and power. A more elaborate well model may be added and many input fields are reserved for this future expansion.

# ZoneHVACAirDistributionUnit

`ZoneHVAC:AirDistributionUnit`
```
The ZoneHVAC:AirDistributionUnit object gives further information on what air loop equipment (air terminal units) will be serving a particular zone. The ZoneHVAC:AirDistributionUnit is the part of the system that is supplied from a common main air handler simulated in the Air Loop Simulation and includes the equipment that controls or tempers the air going to each individual zone according to the desired thermostatic control. The current options for ZoneHVAC:AirDistributionUnit terminal unit types are:
  {AirTerminal:DualDuct:ConstantVolume}
  {AirTerminal:DualDuct:VAV}
  {AirTerminal:DualDuct:VAV:OutdoorAir}
  {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:Reheat}
  {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat}
  {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:NoReheat}
  {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:SeriesPIU:Reheat}
  {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ParallelPIU:Reheat}
  {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:FourPipeInduction}
  {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat:VariableSpeedFan}
  {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:Reheat}
  {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:NoReheat}
  {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:CooledBeam}
  {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:UserDefined}
  {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}
Connections between the air distribution unit, the supply air duct, and the zone are specified in the input syntax for the air distribution unit and the {AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter}. The input syntax also explicitly defines an outlet identifier. This implies a connection to a zone through a {NodeList} for zone inlets (see the {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections} statement). Each air distribution unit is essentially a combined component-controller. Since controls are normally based on the zone thermostat, they can work in parallel or series in complex fashion. Each air distribution unit operates to meet all or part of the remaining thermostat load as specified in {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList}.
The Air Distribution unit also allows the user to specify leaks in the supply air duct system. These inputs are used in the EnergyPlus Simplified Duct Leakage Model (SDLM). This model simulates a specific configuration: supply leaks to a return plenum in a commercial VAV or CV system. The system must have a constant static pressure setpoint. Within these limitations SDLM allows the user to easily evaluate the energy penalty due to duct leakage.
```

##  Field: Name

NominalUpstreamLeakageFraction
```
This is the leakage upstream of the terminal unit as a fraction of the design flow rate through the unit. It is the leakage fraction at the design flow rate. It is used to calculate a leakage flow rate which is then held constant while the system air flow varies. This input is optional; the default is zero.
```
	
##  Field: Constant Downstream Leakage Fraction 
ConstantDownstreamLeakageFraction
```
This is the leakage downstream of the terminal unit as a fraction of the current flow rate through the terminal unit. This fraction is held constant, so the leakage flow rate will vary proportinally with the supply air flow rate. This input is optional; the default is zero.
```
	
##  Field: Design Specification Air Terminal Sizing Name 
DesignSpecificationAirTerminalSizingName
```
This optional input field is the name of a {DesignSpecification:AirTerminal:Sizing} object which specifies sizing adjustments to be made for the air terminal unit referenced by this object. The terminal unit is initially sized according to the inputs in the corresponding {Sizing:Zone} object. Then the adjustment factors in the {DesignSpecification:AirTerminal:Sizing} object are applied. See {DesignSpecification:AirTerminal:Sizing} for more details. If left blank, then no adjustments are made.
```
	
# ZoneHVACEquipmentConnections

`ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections`
```
Finally, the ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections statement defines the remaining details about each thermal zone from an HVAC perspective (besides the controls which were defined above). As with other statements, the first two items in this object are the keyword and an identifying name which links the zone back to its geometrical input, internal gains, etc. and other statements in the HVAC section of the input. The next three items are names of lists (equipment, air inlet nodes, and air exhaust nodes) that are described in more detail below. Note that if there are no air exhaust nodes from the zone that field is left blank. And if there are no air inlet nodes, that field is left blank. Finally, two node names are necessary to complete the zone-HVAC description. The first node is the main air node for the zone upon which the air heat balance is performed. The other node(s) begins the return air path(s) from the zone.
Note that all nodes mentioned in the ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections input must be unique.~ That is, all nodes in all the ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections statements referenced by the ``Zone Air Inlet Nodes'', ``Zone Air Exhaust Nodes'', ``Zone Air Node Name'' and ``Zone Return Air Node Name'' cannot have any node name appearing more than once.
```

##  Field: Zone Name

```
	
##  Field: Zone Conditioning Equipment List Name 
ZoneConditioningEquipmentListName
```
List of zone equipment for this zone in a {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList} object. This list will consist of air distribution units or other direct convection or radiant equipment, i.e.~window air conditioner, baseboard, fan coils, etc.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Air Inlet Node or NodeList Name 
ZoneAirInletNodeOrNodeListName
```
There can be more than one air inlet node depending on how many pieces of equipment are in the {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList}. Generally there will be one air inlet node for each piece of zone equipment that delivers conditioned air to the zone. Components such as electric or hot water baseboards and radiant systems do not require zone air inlet nodes. If there is only one node -- its name can be put in this field. If there is more than one node, this must be the name of a node list object (a node list object can also contain only one node name). If this field is not required (as in the baseboard system), it should be blank.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Air Exhaust Node or NodeList Name 
ZoneAirExhaustNodeOrNodeListName
```
List of exhaust nodes leaving the zone for exhaust fans, zone energy recovery, etc. However these nodes are also used as sources of zone air for zone components such as fan coil units, unit heaters and ventilators, and window air conditioners. For each such component attached to a zone there should be a unique zone exhaust node acting as the inlet node to the component. If there is only one node -- its name can be put in this field. If there is more than one node, this must be the name of a node list object (a node list object can also contain only one node name). If there are no air exhaust nodes, this field should be blank.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Air Node Name 
ZoneAirNodeName
```
The conditions at this node represent the average state of the air in the zone. For zones modeled as fully mixed the conditions at this node are assumed to represent the air in the entire zone. This field is required for all ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections statements.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Return Air Node or NodeList Name 
ZoneReturnAirNodeOrNodeListName
```
The name of one or more return air nodes which attach the zone to an air loop return air path. The conditions at each return node represent the state of the air leaving the zone including any heat gain assigned to that return node from {Lights}, refrigeration equipment or airflow windows.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Return Air Node 1 Flow Rate Fraction Schedule Name 
ZoneReturnAirNode1FlowRateFractionScheduleName
```
The name of a schedule to specify the return air flow rate for the first return air node as a fraction of the base return air. If the next field is blank, then the return air flow rate is the total supply inlet flow rate to the zone less the total exhaust node flow rate from the zone multiplied by this schedule name. If this field is left blank, the schedule defaults to 1.0 at all times.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Return Air Node 1 Flow Rate Basis Node or NodeList Name 
ZoneReturnAirNode1FlowRateBasisNodeOrNodeListName
```
The name of a node or list of nodes ({NodeList}) that is used to calculate the return air flow rate for the first return air node in this zone. The sum of the current flow rates for this node(s) multiplied by the Zone Return Air Node 1 Flow Rate Fraction Schedule determines the return air flow rate. If this field is blank, then the base return air flow rate is the total supply inlet flow rate to the zone less the total exhaust node flow rate from the zone in the case of a single air loop serving this zone. If there are multiple air loops serving this zone, the base return air flow rate is governed by the corresponding supply inlet flow rate and the AirloopHVAC Design Return Air Flow Fraction of Supply Air Flow.
An example of this statement in an IDF is:

The following HVAC equipment types are allowed as zone equipment. The component matrix shows which coils and fans are allowed with which equipment models.
```
	
# ZoneHVACEquipmentList

`ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList`
```
The first list encountered in the {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections} statement is the ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList. This object lists all HVAC equipment serving the zone. Each item in the list has four fields associated with it: Object Type, Name, Cooling Sequence and Heating or No-Load Sequence The Object Type and Name identify the specific equipment object. Cooling Sequence and Heating or No-Load Sequence specify the order of simulation for zones with more than one type of HVAC equipment.
Note that a {ZoneHVAC:AirDistributionUnit} must be listed in this statement if there is a forced air system serving the zone from an air loop.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
Unique identifying name.
```
	
##  Field: Load Distribution Scheme 
LoadDistributionScheme
```
The Load Distribution Scheme selects the algorithm used to allocate the current zone load across the zone equipment. There are four choices: SequentialLoad, UniformLoad, UniformPLR, and SequentialUniformPLR. The default is SequentialLoad. In all cases, the equipment operates in the order specifed by the Zone Equipment Cooling Sequence and Heating or No-Load Sequence fields.
  SequentialLoad loads each piece of available equipment sequentially with the full remaining load.
  UniformLoad evenly distributes the total load equally among all available components on the equipment list for the current load type.
  UniformPLR evenly distributes the total load among all available components on the equipment list for the current load type at a uniform part load ratio (PLR).
  SequentialUniformPLR determines how many of the available components are required to meet the current load, then distributes the load at a uniform part load ratio (PLR).
```
	
##  Field Set (Zone Equipment: Object Type, Name, Cooling Sequence, Heating or No-Load Sequence, Sequential Cooling Fraction Schedule, Sequential Heating Fraction Schedule) 
SetZoneEquipmentObjectTypeNameCoolingSequenceHeatingOrNoLoadSequenceSequentialCoolingFractionScheduleSequentialHeatingFractionSchedule
```
This set is used together in order to sequence the equipment for heating and cooling. The 1 sequence equipment will try to meet the entire demand with its capacity and then pass the results on to the 2 and so on for both heating and cooling. This object is extensible, so additional groups of the following four fields can be added to the end of this object.
Equipment is simulated in the order specified by Zone Equipment Cooling Sequence and Zone Equipment Heating or No-Load Sequence, depending on the current thermostat request. For equipment of similar type, assign sequence 1 to the first system intended to serve that type of load, assign sequence 2 to the next system, and so on. For situations where one or more equipment types has limited capacity or limited control capability, order the sequence so that the most controllable piece of equipment runs last. For example, with a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS), the air terminal for the DOAS should be assigned Heating Sequence = 1 and Cooling Sequence = 1. Any other equipment should be assigned sequence 2 or higher so that it will see the net load after the DOAS air is added to the zone.
```

# ZoneHVACIdealLoadsAirSystem

`ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystem`
```
The simplest piece of zone equipment is the ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystem component. ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystem is used in situations where the user wishes to study the performance of a building without modeling a full HVAC system. In such a case, the Ideal Loads Air System is usually the sole conditioning component: the user does not need to specify air loops, water loops, etc. All that is needed for the ideal system are zone controls, zone equipment configurations, and the ideal loads system component. The use of a return plenum is optional and will require use of the AirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenum object.
This component can be operated with infinite or finite heating and cooling capacity. For either mode---infinite or limited capacity---the user can also specify on/off schedules for heating and cooling and outdoor air controls. There are also optional controls for dehumidification, humidification, economizer, and heat recovery. This component may be used in combination with other HVAC equipment serving the same zone.
This component can be thought of as an ideal unit that mixes air at the zone exhaust condition (or plenum outlet condition when a plenum is attached) with the specified amount of outdoor air and then adds or removes heat and moisture at 100% efficiency in order to produce a supply air stream at the specified conditions. The energy required to condition the supply air is metered and reported as {DistrictHeating} and {DistrictCooling}.
{Notes:} The ideal loads system uses the zone return node or an optional zone exhaust node to extract air from the zone. When the AirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenum is used the inlet of the ideal loads system is connected to the plenum outlet air node while the outlet of the ideal loads system is connected to a zone inlet node. The node name connected between the zone exhaust air node and plenum inlet air node must match in the {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections} and AirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenum objects. Every zone served by an HVAC component must have a return air node, even though this node may not be connected to anything. If more than one ideals loads air systems are connected to the same AirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenum then one of the ideal loads air systems will connect to the ZoneHVAC:ReturnPlenum outlet air node and the remaining ideal loads air systems connected to the same return plenum will connect to the ZoneHVAC:ReturnPlenum induced air outlet nodes.
The ideal loads system was significantly expanded in version 7.0 (October 2011). As part of this upgrade, any change in the moisture content of the supply air stream results in a latent cooling (dehumidification) or latent heating (humidification) load which is metered as {DistrictCooling} and {DistrictHeating} energy consumption. Prior to version 7.0, when the ideal loads system was in heating mode, only the energy for sensible heating was metered. This results in significant changes in reported energy use compared to earlier versions, especially when using the {{ConstantSupplyHumidityRatio}} option for Humidification Control Type.
Older idf files which are transitioned to version 7.0 will automatically be set to use the {{ConstantSupplyHumidityRatio}} option for both dehumidification and humidification controls, because this is equivalent to the controls used in the older version of this system. However, the user should review all of the humidity control options and select the one which best reflects the goal of the simulation.
```

Name
```

```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether or not this component is available to operate during a given time period. If the schedule value is greater than zero then the system is available to operate; otherwise, the system is unavailable for that time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Supply Air Node Name 
ZoneSupplyAirNodeName
```

```
	
##  Field: Zone Exhaust Air Node Name 
ZoneExhaustAirNodeName
```
The name of the zone exhaust air node of the ideal loads object. This should be the same as one of the zone air exhaust nodes for the zone this component is serving.

```
	
##  Field: System Inlet Air Node Name 
SystemInletAirNodeName
```
The optional name of the return plenum outlet node (or induced air outlet node) connected to the ideal loads object. When a return plenum is used, the previous fields for Zone Supply Air Node Name and Zone Exhaust Air Node Name are also required. When an AirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenum is connected to the Ideal Loads Air System the Zone Supply Air Node Name must match a zone air inlet node name and the Zone Exhaust Air Node Name must match a zone air exhaust node (see ZoneHAVC:EquipmentConnections object). The Zone Exhaust Air Node Name must also match an AirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenum inlet node name. In the AirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenum object, when more than one ideal loads air systems are connected to the same return plenum, the System Inlet Air Node Name for one of the ideal loads air systems must match the return plenum Outlet Node Name while all remaining ideal loads air systems, if more than one are connected, would enter the System Inlet Air Node Name in the return plenum Induced Air Outlet Node or {NodeList} Name field (see Engineering Reference for schematic).

The name of a schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether heating is available. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that heating and humidification are available. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that heating and humidification are not available. If blank, heating and humidification are always available.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Availability Schedule Name

For {{ConstantSensibleHeatRatio}} and {{Humidistat}}, if the mixed air humidity ratio is less than the target humidity ratio, then the mixed air humidity ratio will be used. For all options, the supply air humidity ratio will never be allowed to exceed saturation at the supply dry bulb temperature.
The selected dehumidification control type is always applied when the unit is in cooling mode. If the unit is in deadband mode (not actively heating the supply air) control type {{Humidistat}} will be active. If the unit is in heating mode, control type {{Humidistat}} will be active if the Humidification Control Type field below is set to {Humidistat} or {None}.
This allows the ideal loads system to heat and dehumidify at the same time.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Sensible Heat Ratio 
CoolingSensibleHeatRatio
```
When the Dehumidification Control Type is set to {{ConstantSensibleHeatRatio}} the ideal loads system will be controlled to meet the sensible cooling load, and the latent cooling rate will be computed using the value of Cooling Sensible Heat Ratio (SHR), where SHR = Sensible Cooling divided by Total Cooling (sensible plus latent). The default is 0.7. If Dehumidification Control Type is set to something other than {{ConstantSensibleHeatRatio}} then this field will be ignored.
```
	
##  Field: Humidification Control Type 
HumidificationControlType
```
Select from {{None}}, {{Humidistat, or ConstantSupplyHumidityRatio}}. {{None}} means that there is no humidification. {{Humidistat}} means that there is a {ZoneControl:Humidistat} for this zone and the ideal loads system will attempt to meet the humidistat request (i.e., humidify according to the Humidifying Relative Humidity Setpoint Schedule in the {ZoneControl:Humidistat} object).   {{ConstantSupplyHumidityRatio}} means that during heating the supply air will always be at the Maximum Heating Supply Humidity Ratio. The default is {{None}}. For {{Humidistat}}, if the mixed air humidity ratio is greater than the target humidity ratio, then the mixed air humidity ratio will be used. For all options, the supply air humidity ratio will never be allowed to exceed saturation at the supply dry bulb temperature.
The selected humidification control type is always applied when the unit is in heating mode. If the unit is in deadband mode (not actively heating the supply air) control type {{Humidistat}} will be active. If the unit is in cooling mode, control type {{Humidistat}} will be active if the Dehumidification Control Type field above is set to {Humidistat} or {None}.
This allows the ideal loads system to cool and humidify at the same time.

# ZoneHVACFourPipeFanCoil

`ZoneHVAC:FourPipeFanCoil`
```
What is a fan coil unit? Like many HVAC terms, ``fan coil unit'' is used rather loosely. Sometimes it is used for terminal units that would be better described as powered induction units. Carrier and others use the term for the room side of refrigerant-based split systems. Here we are modeling in-room forced-convection hydronic units. The hydronic heating coil may be replaced with an electric heating coil. Typically these units are small (200--1200 cfm) and self-contained. They are mostly used in exterior zones, usually in hotels, apartments, or offices. They may be connected to ducted outside air, or have a direct outside air vent, but they do not have outside air economizers. Units with outside air economizers are marketed (in the United States) as unit ventilators. Unit ventilators are typically bigger than fan coils and are widely used in classrooms or other applications where ventilation is a priority. If a zonal unit with an outside economizer is desired, {{ZoneHVAC:UnitVentilator}} should be used.
The heating or cooling output of the fan coil unit is controlled by varying the air flow rate, the water flow rate, or both. Air flow rate can be controlled by cycling the fan on/off or with a variable speed fan drive. The most common setup is a two or three speed fan with the speed selected by hand. The fan then cycles on/off to control heating / cooling output. The controls are often a wall mounted thermostat with hand selection of heating/cooling and fan speed (off/low/medium/high). These controls may also be mounted on the unit.
Carrier offers a retrofit VSD motor for fan coil units. It claims up to 45% energy savings from such a retrofit, as well as increased comfort and less noise compared to a cycling fan (fan coil fans are typically noisy and inefficient). Some other manufacturers are also offering units with VSD fans. Variable speed fans appear to offer an easy way to significantly increase the efficiency of what have typically been very inefficient units.
EnergyPlus provides 6 capacity control methods for this unit:
  multi-speed cycling fan with constant water flow rate
  constant speed continuous fan with variable water flow rate
  variable-speed fan with constant water flow rate
  variable-speed fan with variable water flow rate
  multi-speed fan with cycling between speeds and constant water flow.
  fan speed control based on ASHRAE 90.1
In EnergyPlus the fan coil units are modeled as compound components. That is, they are assembled from other components. Fan coils contain an outdoor air mixer, a fan, a heating coil and a cooling coil. These components are described elsewhere in this document. The fan coil input simply requires the names of these four components, which have to be described elsewhere in the input. The input also requires the name of an availability schedule, maximum airflow rate, outdoor airflow rate, and maximum and minimum hot (for hydronic heating coil only) and cold water volumetric flow rates. The unit is connected to the zone inlet and exhaust nodes and the outdoor air by specifying unit inlet, and outlet air node names and the outdoor air mixer object name. The outdoor air mixer child object provides the outdoor air and relief air nodes names. Note that the unit air inlet node should be the same as a zone exhaust node and the unit outlet node should be the same as a zone inlet node. The fan coil unit is connected to a hot water loop through its hot water coil or with no hot water loop when using an electric coil (demand side) and to a chilled water loop (demand side) through its cooling coil.
Note that the type of fan component associated with the fan coil unit depends on the type of capacity control method chosen. For {ConstantFanVariableFlow~} a {{Fan:OnOff}} or {{Fan:ConstantVolume}} should be used. For {CyclingFan}, a {{Fan:OnOff}} should be used, for {VariableFanVariableFlow} or {VariableFanConstantFlow} a {{Fan:VariableVolume}}, for {MultiSpeedFan} a {{Fan:OnOff}} should be used, and for {ASHRAE90VariableFan}, a {{Fan:OnOff}} or {{Fan:VariableVolume}} should be chosen.
Fan coil units can be 4-pipe or 2-pipe. For 4-pipe units there are 2 supply pipes and 2 return pipes. For 2-pipe units there is a single supply pipe and a single return pipe and the supply is switched between hot and chilled water depending on the season. EnergyPlus models 4-pipe units, but the 4-pipe model can be used to model 2-pipe~units by using the coil availability schedules to make sure that either hot or chilled water is exclusively available. Fan coil units with hydronic heat can instead be modeled using an electric heating coil if desired (i.e., replace the hydronic heating coil with an electric heating coil).
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
A unique user assigned name for an instance of a Fan Coil unit. Any reference to this Fan Coil unit by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the fan coil unit can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the component can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the component must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Capacity Control Method 
CapacityControlMethod
```
This input denotes how the unit's output is controlled in order to meet zone heating or cooling requirement. The choices are {{ConstantFanVariableFlow}}, {{CyclingFan}}, {{VariableFanVariableFlow}}, {{VariableFanConstantFlow}}, {{MultiSpeedFan}}, or {{ASHRAE90VariableFan}}. For {ConstantFanVariableFlow}, the fan speed is held constant to produce a fixed air flow rate whenever the unit is scheduled on. The hot water or chilled flow rate is varied so that the unit output matches the zone heating or cooling requirement. For {CyclingFan}, the fan speed is chosen so that the unit capacity is greater than or equal to the heating / cooling load and the fan is cycled to match unit output with the load. For {VariableFanVariableFlow} ~both air and water flow rates are varied to match the load. For {VariableFanConstantFlow,} the water flow rate is at full flow and the fan speed varies to meet the load. For {MultiSpeedFan} the water flow rate is at full flow when there is load or fully closed when there is no load and the supply air flow rate is varied by varying the fan speed in order to match the load. For {ASHRAE90VariableFan}, the fan air flow rate is reduced according to the low speed supply air flow ratio when the zone sensible load is less than the zone sensible load multiplied by the low speed supply air flow ratio. The water coil water flow rate, or the electric heating coil part-load ratio, is modulated to meet the zone load. If the zone sensible load is greater than the zone sensible load multiplied by the low speed supply air flow ratio, then the air and water flow rate is increased to meet the load. If the zone load is greater than the design sensible load, the fan air flow rate is maintained at the maximum value while the water flow rate is further increased to the maximum available while electric heating coils are maintained at the maximum output.
{{Note: when ASHRAE90VariableFan is selected, if the the Minimum Supply Air Temperature in Cooling/Heating Mode inputs are not specified, the simulation must include zone sizing to calculate the zone design sensible cooling and heating load used to modulate the fan speed and, for water coils, the water flow rate or for electric heating coils, the part load ratio.}}
{{MultiSpeedFan:}} for a given load, the fan cycles between speeds when fan speed selected is higher than the minimum speed or the fan cycles on-off when the fan speed selected is the minimum and the fan operating schedule is cycling fan. When the fan is operating as a continuous fan, then the fan runs at minimum speed even when there is no load to meet. When the speed selected is higher than the minimum speed, then the fan cycles between consecutive speed regardless of the fan operating schedule type. The model selects at what fan speed to run depending on cooling or heating load.

This input field is currently used with {MultiSpeedFan} capacity control method only.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Supply Air Temperature in Cooling Mode 
MinimumSupplyAirTemperatureInCoolingMode
```
This optional input is used only when {Capacity Control~Method = ASHRAE90VariableFan}. Specify the minimum supply air temperature in cooling mode. When the fan coil capacity is greater than the zone load, the fan speed will modulate down to the minimum fan speed, based on the Low Speed Supply Air Flow Ratio input field, and the water flow rate will also be reduced to maintain the zone thermostat set point temperature. When the zone load is one-half the fan coil capacity, the fan will operate at the minimum speed. When these fields are not entered, a zone sizing simulation must be performed. Both the cooling and heating supply air temperature must be entered or blank in unison. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable. A value of 0 (in both fields) will disregard these fields.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Supply Air Temperature in Heating Mode 
MaximumSupplyAirTemperatureInHeatingMode
```
This optional input is used only when {Capacity Control~Method = ASHRAE90VariableFan}. Specify the maximum supply air temperature in heating mode.

When the zone load is one-half the fan coil capacity, the fan will operate at the minimum speed. When these fields are not entered, a zone sizing simulation must be performed. Both the cooling and heating supply air temperature must be entered or blank in unison. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable. A value of 0 (in both fields) will disregard these fields.

# ZoneHVACUnitVentilator

`ZoneHVAC:UnitVentilator`
```
Unit ventilators are zone equipment units which are assembled from other components. They contain a built-in outdoor air mixer, a fan, a heating coil, and a cooling coil. These components are described elsewhere in this document, except the built-in outdoor air mixer which is contained within the unit ventilator statement. The unit ventilator input simply requires the names of these other three components, which have to be described elsewhere in the input. The input also requires the name of an availability schedule, maximum airflow rate, outdoor air control information (control type and schedules) and an outdoor airflow rate. The unit is connected to the zone inlet and exhaust nodes and the outdoor air by specifying unit inlet, outlet, outdoor air, mixed air and exhaust (relief) air node names. Note that if the Unit Ventilator is not connected to central dedicated outdoor air (DOA), then the unit air inlet node should be the same as a zone exhaust air node and the unit air outlet node should be the same as a zone air inlet node. The three node name input fields: {Outdoor Air Node Name}, {Exhaust Air Node Name}, and {Mixed Air Node Name} are required fields only when the built-in outdoor air mixer is used to provide outdoor air. If the Unit Ventilator is connected to a central dedicated outdoor air (DOA) via {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}}, then the above three node name input fields are not required and must be left blank. In the later case the Unit Ventilator node connection to the zone air exhaust node and the zone air inlet node are described in {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object. In general, the unit ventilator input is very similar to the fan coil unit input, and the unit is connected to a hot water loop (demand side) through its hot water coil and to a chilled water loop (demand side) through its cooling coil.
The main difference between the fan coil and unit ventilator input is that the unit ventilator has a built-in outdoor air mixer with its own specialized controls. The outdoor air control type can be selected from one of the following options: ``variable percent'', ``fixed temperature'' or ``fixed amount''. In fixed temperature control, the amount of outdoor air is varied between the minimum outdoor air fraction (specified by a schedule) and 100% outdoor air to obtain a mixed air temperature as close as possible to the temperature schedule defined in the input. Variable percent control will also vary the amount of outdoor air between the minimum and maximum fractions (both specified in input by the user) to meet the load without the use of a coil if possible. In fixed amount control, the outdoor air flow rate is fixed to the specified value by the user. In this control strategy, the maximum outdoor air flow rate and schedule are automatically set to be equal to the minimum outdoor air flow rate and schedule. These control types are based on the 2004 ASHRAE Systems and Equipment Handbook (pp.~31.1-31.3) description of unit ventilator systems. The three outdoor air control strategies are also valid and available when the Unit Ventilator is connected to central DOA.
The unit is controlled to meet the zone (remaining) heating or cooling demand. If there is a heating demand, the cooling coil is off and the hot water flow through the heating coil is throttled to meet the demand. If there is a cooling demand from the zone, the hot water coil is off and the chilled water flow through the cooling coil is throttled to meet the load. Finally both heating and cooling require a convergence tolerance, which is the tolerance denoting how closely the fan coil unit will meet the heating or cooling load. The tolerance is always relative to the zone load.
Overall, control of the unit must consider the outdoor air. Here is a more detailed description of the overall unit control:
{Off:} Unit is schedule off or there is no load on it. All flow rates are set to zero and the temperatures are set to zone conditions (except for the outdoor air inlet). Outdoor air requirements will not override this condition.
{Heating/No Coil/VariablePercent:} The unit is on, there is a heating load, no heating coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and variable percent outdoor air control type has been specified. In this case, the variable percent outdoor air controls what happens with the outdoor air. If the outside temperature is greater than the return temperature, then the outdoor air is set to the maximum as defined by the user input. If the outdoor air temperature is less than the return temperature from the zone, then the outdoor air is set to the minimum outdoor air flow rate as defined by the user. Since a coil is not present to further condition the supply air, the zone simply receives whatever temperature air results from the outdoor air controls.
{Heating/No Coil/FixedTemperature:} The unit is on, there is a heating load, no heating coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and fixed temperature has been specified. The unit ventilator tries to use outdoor air as best as possible to meet the temperature goal. If it cannot meet this goal because the temperature goal is not between the zone return temperature and the outdoor air temperature, then the unit ventilator will either use the maximum or minimum outdoor air flow rate.
{Heating/No Coil/FixedAmount:} The unit is on, there is a heating load, no heating coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and fixed amount control has been specified. The unit ventilator fixes the outdoor air flow rate as defined by the user and sets the maximum and minimum outdoor air flow rate to be equal in order to avoid the variation of outdoor air flow rate between the maximum and minimum values. Since a coil is not present to further condition the supply air, the zone simply receives whatever temperature air results from the outdoor air controls.
{Heating /With Coil/VariablePercent:} The unit is on, there is a heating load, and variable percent control is specified. The outdoor air fraction is set to the minimum outdoor air fraction (schedule based), and the heating coil is activated. The heating coil attempts to meet the remaining load on the zone being served by the unit ventilator.
{Heating /With Coil/FixedAmount:} The unit is on, there is a heating load, a heating coil is present and is scheduled on, and fixed amount control has been specified. The unit ventilator fixes the outdoor air flow rate as defined by the user and sets the maximum and minimum outdoor air flow rate to be equal in order to avoid the variation of outdoor air flow rate between the maximum and minimum values. The heating coil then attempts to meet any remaining zone heating load.
{Cooling/No Coil/VariablePercent:} The unit is on, there is a cooling load, no coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and variable percent outdoor air control type has been specified. In this case, the variable percent outdoor air controls what happens with the outdoor air. If the outside temperature is greater than the return temperature, then the outdoor air is set to the minimum as defined by the user input. If the outdoor air temperature is less than the return temperature from the zone, then the outdoor air is varied up to the maximum flow rate to try to meet whatever cooling load is present. Since a coil is not present to further condition the supply air, the zone simply receives whatever temperature air results from the outdoor air controls.
{Cooling/No Coil/FixedTemperature:} The unit is on, there is a cooling load, no cooling coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and fixed temperature has been specified. The unit ventilator tries to use outdoor air as best as possible to meet the temperature goal. If it cannot meet this goal because the temperature goal is not between the zone return temperature and the outdoor air temperature, then the unit ventilator will either use the maximum or minimum outdoor air flow rate in the same fashion as the variable percent outdoor air control.
{Cooling/No Coil/FixedAmount:} The unit is on, there is a cooling load, no cooling coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and fixed amount control has been specified. The unit ventilator fixes the outdoor air flow rate as defined by the user and sets the maximum and minimum outdoor air flow rate to be equal in order to avoid the variation of outdoor air flow rate between the maximum and minimum values. Since a coil is not present to further condition the supply air, the zone simply receives whatever temperature air results from the outside air controls.
{Cooling/With Coil/VariablePercent:} The unit is on, there is a cooling load, a coil is present and is scheduled on, and variable percent outdoor air control type has been specified. In this case, the variable percent outdoor air controls what happens with the outdoor air. If the outside temperature is greater than the return temperature, then the outdoor air is set to the minimum as defined by the user input. If the outdoor air temperature is less than the return temperature from the zone, then the outdoor air is varied up to the maximum flow rate to try to meet whatever cooling load is present. The coil then attempts to meet any remaining zone load.
{Cooling/With Coil/FixedTemperature:} The unit is on, there is a cooling load, a cooling coil is present and is scheduled on, and fixed temperature has been specified. The unit ventilator tries to use outdoor air as best as possible to meet the temperature goal. If it cannot meet this goal because the temperature goal is not between the zone return temperature and the outdoor air temperature, then the unit ventilator will either use the maximum or minimum outdoor air flow rate in the same fashion as the fixed temperature outdoor air control for the ``no coil'' conditions. The cooling coil then attempts to meet any remaining zone load.
{Cooling/With Coil/FixedAmount:} The unit is on, there is a cooling load, a cooling coil is present and is scheduled on, and fixed amount control has been specified. The unit ventilator fixes the outdoor air flow rate as defined by the user and sets the maximum and minimum outdoor air flow rate to be equal in order to avoid the variation of outdoor air flow rate between the maximum and minimum values. The cooling coil then attempts to meet any remaining zone cooling load.
Note: the unit ventilator controls are strictly temperature based and do not factor humidity into the equation (not an enthalpy economy cycle but rather a simple return air economy cycle). In addition, temperature predictions are not strict energy balances here in the control routine though in the mixing routine an energy balance is preserved.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This field is simply the identifying name that distinguishes one particular unit ventilator from another in the input data file. Like all other names in EnergyPlus, it is assumed that this is a unique character string and that no other unit ventilators use this same name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This field is a schedule name (ref: Schedule) that determines whether the unit ventilator is available to operate. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the component can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the component must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Supply Air Flow Rate 
MaximumSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This field allows the user to enter the maximum volumetric flow rate of air through the unit ventilator system in m^{3}/sec.~This parameter should be some real number greater than zero.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Control Type 
OutdoorAirControlType
```
This field allows the user to control how outdoor air is used in the unit ventilator system. The unit ventilator system described by this syntax has its own outdoor air handler. The three options for outdoor air control are ``{VariablePercent}'', ``{FixedTemperature}'' and ``{FixedAmount}''. Those keys are the only allowed choices for this parameter. In general, the variable percent control will attempt to vary the amount of outdoor air between some minimum and maximum schedules of fractions (see next two fields) to best meet the current heating or cooling load. The fixed temperature control will vary the amount of outdoor air between the minimum schedule (fraction of maximum, see next field) and 100% available outdoor air to come as close as possible to a desired mixed air temperature (see 2 fields down) that can be scheduled. The fixed amount control will fix the outdoor air flow rate as minimum outdoor air flow rate and schedule specified by the user and automatically set the maximum and minimum outside flow rate to be equal by ignoring the maximum outdoor air flow rate. More information on the controls and operation of the unit ventilator are given in the introductory section above. For cycling fan operating mode, the outdoor air mass rate is capped by the actual supply air flow rate if the former is greater than the latter; otherwise, uses the amount calculated by the outdoor air control.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Outdoor Air Flow Rate 
MinimumOutdoorAirFlowRate
```
This field allows the user to enter the minimum volumetric flow rate of outdoor air (in m^{3}/sec) that will be brought in to the unit ventilator. The actual minimum outdoor air flow rate will be this number multiplied by the schedule value from the minimum outdoor air schedule. If ``{FixedAmount}'' type is selected as the outdoor air control strategy, the outdoor air flow rate will be fixed as this field and the unit ventilator will automatically set the maximum and minimum outside flow rate to be equal by ignoring the maximum outdoor air flow rate.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Outdoor Air Schedule Name 
MinimumOutdoorAirScheduleName
```
This field contains a schedule name (ref: Schedule) that should contain values for the minimum outdoor air used by the unit ventilator system for IAQ or other reasons. Note that if the unit ventilator is scheduled off or if there is no load sensed in the zone that the system will not operate even to achieve the minimum air fraction. However, if the system is operating, it will always bring in this fraction of the minimum air flow rate (see minimum air flow rate field above). If ``FixedAmount'' type is selected as the outdoor air control strategy, the actual outdoor air flow rate will be this number multiplied by the minimum outdoor air flow rate in the field above. The unit ventilator will automatically set the maximum and minimum outdoor air schedule to be equal by ignoring the maximum outdoor air schedule.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Outdoor Air Flow Rate 
MaximumOutdoorAirFlowRate
```
This field allows the user to enter the maximum volumetric flow rate of outdoor air that can be brought into the unit ventilator system in m^{3}/sec.~This parameter should be some real number greater than zero. Note that the value for this parameter may be less than the maximum air flow rate of the unit ventilator and this may affect the maximum fraction of outdoor air within the control strategy defined above. This parameter is an absolute maximum and will supercede any scheduled fraction of the unit ventilator maximum airflow rate. If ``FixedAmount'' type is selected as the outdoor air control strategy, this field will be ignored and be automatically set to be equal to the minimum outdoor air flow rate specified in the field above.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Outdoor Air Fraction or Temperature Schedule Name 
MaximumOutdoorAirFractionOrTemperatureScheduleName
```
This field can have one of two meanings depending the type of control selected in the outdoor air control type parameter above. If ``VariablePercent'' or ``FixedAmount'' was selected, then this field is a schedule name (ref: Schedule) corresponding to a maximum air fraction schedule. Furthermore, if ``FixedAmount'' type is selected as the outdoor air control strategy, this field will be ignored and be automatically set to be equal to the minimum outdoor air fraction specified in the field below. Note that this is a fraction of the maximum airflow rate field (see parameter above) for the unit ventilator. If ``FixedTemperature'' control was selected, then this field is still a schedule name (ref: Schedule), but it corresponds to a schedule of mixed air temperatures that the outdoor air control will try to attain.
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
This field is a node name used to identify the node that serves as the inlet (air side) to the unit ventilator. In a unit ventilator, the air inlet node name must be zone exhaust node name if there is no DOA Mixer, or if the unit ventilator is connected to DOA, then the air inlet node name must be the DOA mixer outlet node name for InletSide mixer connection. In EnergyPlus, nodes represent points between components or at various points in the loops. While a node name may be referenced more than once in an input data file, each node must have a unique name. In addition, the air inlet node name can be the name of an induced air outlet node (Ref. {AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenum}) to draw air from a return plenum, when the zone return node is connected to a return plenum.
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName
```
This field is a node name used to identify the node that serves as the outlet (air side) to the unit ventilator. In a unit ventilator, the air outlet node name must be zone inlet node name if there is no DOA Mixer, or if the unit ventilator is connected to DOA, then the air outlet node name must be the DOA mixer secondary air inlet node name for SupplySide mixer connection. In EnergyPlus, nodes represent points between components or at various points in the loops. While a node name may be referenced more than once in an input data file, each node must have a unique name.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Node Name 
OutdoorAirNodeName
```
This field is a node name used to identify the node associated with fresh air brought into the unit ventilator from the outdoor environment. You should also have defined an {OutdoorAir:Node} object with the same name and assign it an optional height (above ground). This input field must be left blank if the Unit ventilator is connected to a central dedicated outdoor air (DOA) via {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object.
```
	
##  Field: Exhaust Air Node Name 
ExhaustAirNodeName
```
This field is a node name used to identify the node associated with air exhausted out of the unit ventilator to the outdoor environment. While from a simulation standpoint this name is arbitrary and not a ``necessity'', assigning a name to this node allows the user to receive output on conditions at this node to verify the correct operation of the unit ventilator. This input field must be left blank if the Unit ventilator is connected to a central dedicated outdoor air (DOA) via {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object.
```
	
##  Field: Mixed Air Node Name 
MixedAirNodeName
```
This field is a node name used to identify the node associated with the ``mixed'' air of the unit ventilator. These conditions are post-``mixing box'' since they are the conditions of the fraction of return air combined with the outdoor air. Since this is a simple system, this can also be viewed as the conditions of the air being sent to the coils. While from a simulation standpoint this name is arbitrary and not a ``necessity'', assigning a name to this node allows the user to receive output on conditions at this node to verify the correct operation of the unit ventilator. This input field must be left blank if the Unit ventilator is connected to a central dedicated outdoor air (DOA) via {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Object Type 
SupplyAirFanObjectType
```
This field specifies the type of supply air fan used by this unit ventilator. The supply air fan is part of the unit ventilator compound object. The only valid supply air fan types are:
  {Fan:SystemModel}
  {Fan:OnOff}
  {Fan:ConstantVolume}
  {Fan:VariableVolume}
Note that {Fan:SystemModel} was added as of version 8.7 and is recommended for use in new models.  {Fan:OnOff}, {Fan:ConstantVolume}, and {Fan:VariableVolume} may be deprecated in a future version.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Name 
SupplyAirFanName
```
This field is the name of a fan (ref: {Fan:SystemModel}, {Fan:OnOff}, {Fan:ConstantVolume}, {Fan:VariableVolume}) that is part of the unit ventilator system. This name links the unit ventilator to particular fan data entered elsewhere in the input data file. A fan name is required since it is the prime mover of air in the unit ventilator system.
```
	
##  Field: Coil Option 
CoilOption
```
This field allows the user to specify the coil operating options as one of the following options: {None}, {Heating}, {Cooling} or {HeatingAndCooling}. If {None} is selected, the unit ventilator does not have any coils, and any other input will be ignored. If either {Heating} or {Cooling} is selected, only a heating or cooling coil, respectively, is present. Thus, only four more inputs will be expected. If {HeatingAndCooling} is selected, both heating and cooling coil input must be entered, and the unit ventilator will have both a heating and a cooling coil.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name 
SupplyAirFanOperatingModeScheduleName
```
This field is a schedule name (ref: Schedule) that determines the operating modes of the unit ventilator's On:Off fan. A schedule value of 0 indicates cycling fan operation (fan cycles with cooling/heating coil). A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates constant fan operation (fan runs continually regardless of the coils operation). If this input field is left blank, then the operating mode of the On:Off fan type defaults to cycling operation.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Object Type 
HeatingCoilObjectType
```
This field is the type of coil that is used for heating in the unit ventilator system. It is used in conjunction with the heating coil name (see next field) to specify the heating coil present within the system. Allowable heating coil types are:
  {Coil:Heating:Water}
  {Coil:Heating:Electric}
  {Coil:Heating:Fuel}
  {Coil:Heating:Steam}
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Name 
HeatingCoilName
```
This field is the name of the heating coil that is part of the unit ventilator system. It is assumed that there is always some sort of heating coil associated with a unit ventilator system. This name links the unit ventilator to particular heating coil data entered elsewhere in the input data file.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Convergence Tolerance 
HeatingConvergenceTolerance
```
The control tolerance for the unit heating output. This field allows the user some control over how closely the heating coil will control the air side conditions. The relative size of this parameter relates directly to the closeness of the control. A very small value in this field will result in tight control and will probably result in larger numbers of iterations. A large value in this field will result in looser controls and could result in unsatisfactory fluctuations in supply conditions (that could in turn result in excessive iterations). Initial experience with this parameter lends to the recommendation of using 0.001 as a starting point. This field is ignored for gas and electric heating coils.
The unit is controlled by matching the unit output to the zone demand. For units with water coils, the model must be numerically inverted to obtain a specified output. The heating convergence tolerance is the error tolerance used to terminate the numerical inversion procedure. Basically this is the fraction:
\frac{{\left| {{Q_{UnitVentilator,Out}} - {Q_{ZoneLoad}}} \right|}}{{{Q_{ZoneLoad}}}} \le HeatingConvergenceTolerance
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Coil Object Type 
CoolingCoilObjectType
```
This field is the type of coil that is used for cooling in the unit ventilator system. It is used in conjunction with the cooling coil name (see next field) to specify the cooling coil present within the system.
Only the following coil types can be used:
  {Coil:Cooling:Water}
  {Coil:Cooling:Water:DetailedGeometry}
  {CoilSystem:Cooling:Water:HeatExchangerAssisted}
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Coil Name 
CoolingCoilName
```
This field is the name of the cooling coil that is part of the unit ventilator system. This name links the unit ventilator to particular cooling coil data entered elsewhere in the input data file. Note that a cooling coil is not a required part of a unit ventilator system. If no cooling coil is present, the previous field may be followed by a semi-colon and the remaining parameters in this statement may be ignored.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Convergence Tolerance 
CoolingConvergenceTolerance
```
The convergence tolerance for the unit cooling output. This field allows the user some control over how closely the cooling coil will control the air side conditions. The relative size of this parameter relates directly to the closeness of the control. A very small value in this field will result in tight control and will probably result in larger numbers of iterations. A large value in this field will result in looser controls and could result in unsatisfactory fluctuations in supply conditions (that could in turn result in excessive iterations). Initial experience with this parameter lends to the recommendation of using 0.001 as a starting point.
The unit is controlled by matching the unit output to the zone demand. For units with water coils, the model must be numerically inverted to obtain a specified output. The cooling convergence tolerance is the error tolerance used to terminate the numerical inversion procedure. Basically this is the fraction:
\frac{{\left| {{Q_{UnitVentilator,Out}} - {Q_{ZoneLoad}}} \right|}}{{{Q_{ZoneLoad}}}} \le CoolingConvergenceTolerance
```
	
##  Field: Availability Manager List Name 
AvailabilityManagerListName
```
This optional input field is the name of an {AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList} object. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this unit ventilator object's fan. If the unit ventilator is available (per the Availability Schedule Name input field above) and this input field has a valid availability manager assignment list name, then the availability managers in the list determine when and if the fan of this unit ventilator object should be on or off.
```
	
##  Field: Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing Object Name 
DesignSpecificationZoneHVACSizingObjectName
```
This optional input field is the name of a {DesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizing} object. The name must correspond to unique name of a {DesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizing} object. A Design Sepcification Zone HVAC Sizing object defines scalable sizing methods for sizing input fields such as Maximum Air Flow Rate in this Unit Ventilator zone HVAC object. The scaled Maximum Air Flow Rate in turn is used to size cooling and heating capacity of the unit.
An example input for a unit ventilator, including its constituent components, is shown below.

# ZoneHVACUnitHeater

`ZoneHVAC:UnitHeater`
```
Unit heaters are zone equipment units which are assembled from other components and are a simplification of unit ventilators. They contain only a fan and a heating coil. These components are described elsewhere in this document. The unit heater input simply requires the names of these components, which have to be described elsewhere in the input. The input also requires the name of an availability schedule, maximum airflow rate, and maximum and minimum hot water volumetric flow rates. The unit is connected to the zone inlet and exhaust nodes by specifying unit inlet and outlet node names. Note that the unit air inlet node should be the same as a zone exhaust node and the unit outlet node should be the same as a zone inlet node.
While the control of the heating coil is similar to the fan coil units and the unit ventilator, the overall control of the unit heater is much different. There are four different modes in which a unit heat can operate based on the user input:
{Off:} Unit is schedule off. All flow rates are set to zero and the temperatures are set to zone conditions.
{NoLoad OR Cooling/''No''} is specified in input field ``Supply Air Fan Operation During No Heating''{:} Unit is available, but there is no heating load. With ``No'' specified for ``Supply Air Fan Operation During No Heating'' and the supply fan operating mode set to 0, the fan will be off since there is no heating load. All flow rates are set to zero and the temperatures are set to zone conditions.
{NoLoad OR Cooling/''Yes''} is specified in input field ``Supply Air Fan Operation During No Heating''{:} Unit is available, the supply fan operating mode schedule value is greater than 0 (for OnOff Fan) and the fan is running (if it is scheduled to be available also). No heating is provided, only air circulation via the fan running. However, any heat added by the fan is introduced into the space with the circulation of the air.
{Heating:} The unit is on/available and there is a heating load. The heating coil is modulated (constant fan speed) to meet the heating load. When the fan type is not an OnOff fan then the~ control of the heating coil and its flow rate is identical to the fan coil unit. In the case of OnOff fan, the fan cycles with heating coil if the current timestep supply fan operating mode is schedule value is 0, or else if the current timestep supply fan operating mode schedule value is greater than 0, then the supply fan runs continuously for the entire timestep.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This field is simply the identifying name that distinguishes one particular unit heater from another in the input data file. Like all other names in EnergyPlus, it is assumed that this is a unique character string and that no other unit heaters use this same name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This field is a schedule name (ref: Schedule) that determines whether the unit heater is available to operate. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the component can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the component must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
This field is a node name used to identify the node that serves as the inlet (air side) to the unit heater. In EnergyPlus, nodes represent points between components or at various points in the loops. In a unit heater, the air inlet node to the system will typically be the same node as a zone outlet node. While a node name may be referenced more than once in an input data file, each node must have a unique name.
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName
```
This field is a node name used to identify the node that serves as the outlet (air side) to the unit heater. In EnergyPlus, nodes represent points between components or at various points in the loops. In a unit heater, the air outlet node from the system will typically be the same node as a zone inlet node. While a node name may be referenced more than once in an input data file, each node must have a unique name.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Object Type 
SupplyAirFanObjectType
```
This field specifies the type of supply air fan used by this unit heater. The supply air fan is part of the unit heater compound object. The only valid supply air fan types are:
  {Fan:SystemModel}
  {Fan:OnOff}
  {Fan:ConstantVolume}
  {Fan:VariableVolume}
Note that {Fan:SystemModel} was added as of version 8.7 and is recommended for use in new models.  {Fan:OnOff}, {Fan:ConstantVolume}, and {Fan:VariableVolume} may be deprecated in a future version.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Name 
SupplyAirFanName
```
This field is the name of a fan (ref: FanSystemModel, {Fan:ConstantVolume}, {Fan:VariableVolume}) that is part of the unit heater system. This name links the unit heater to particular fan data entered elsewhere in the input data file. A fan name is required since it is the prime mover of air in the unit heater system.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Supply Air Flow Rate 
MaximumSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This field allows the user to enter the maximum volumetric flow rate of air through the unit heater system in m^{3}/s. This parameter should be some real number greater than zero.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Object Type 
HeatingCoilObjectType
```
This field is the type of coil that is used for heating in the unit heater system. It is used in conjunction with the heating coil name (see next field) to specify the heating coil present within the system. Allowable heating coil types are:
  {Coil:Heating:Water}
  {Coil:Heating:Electric}
  {Coil:Heating:Fuel}
  {Coil:Heating:Steam}
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Name 
HeatingCoilName
```
This field is the name of the heating coil that is part of the unit heater system. It is assumed that there is always some sort of heating coil associated with a unit heater system. This name links the unit ventilator to particular heating coil data entered elsewhere in the input data file.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name 
SupplyAirFanOperatingModeScheduleName
```
This field is a schedule name (ref: Schedule) that determines the operating modes of the unit heater's On:Off fan. A schedule value of 0 indicates cycling fan operation (fan cycles with cooling/heating coil). A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates constant fan operation (fan runs continually regardless of the coils operation). If this input field is left blank, then the operating mode of the On:Off fan type defaults to cycling operation.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Operation During No Heating 
SupplyAirFanOperationDuringNoHeating
```
This choice field allows the user to define how the unit heater will operate under ``no heating load'' or cooling conditions. The user may select from two options (``Yes'', ``No''). If the ``{No}'' control is selected, then the fan will not run unless there is a heating load. If the fan does not run, this effectively shuts the unit heater system off. If the ``{Yes}'' control is selected, the unit heater is available, and the fan is continuous, then the fan will always run. This will produce air movement in the zone but also add some amount of heat to the energy balance since the fan generates some heat. But if the ``{Yes}'' control is selected and the ``Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule'' values is 0 (for OnOff fan), then the fan will NOT run.~ This allows the user to schedule the operation of the fan when there is no load.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate 
MaximumHotWaterOrSteamFlowRate
```
This field allows the user to enter a maximum hot water or steam volumetric flow rate through the heating coil in m^{3}/s. The steam volume flow rate is calculated at 100C and 101325 Pa. This number should be some number greater than zero and greater than the minimum hot water or steam volumetric flow rate (see next field). Note that this parameter has no meaning for either an electric or a gas heating coil.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate 
MinimumHotWaterOrSteamFlowRate
```
This field allows the user to enter a minimum hot water or steam volumetric flow rate through the heating coil in m^{3}/s. The steam volume flow rate is calculated at 100C and 101325 Pa. This number should be some number greater than zero and less than the maximum hot water or steam volumetric flow rate (see previous field). Note that this parameter has no meaning for either an electric or a gas heating coil.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Convergence Tolerance 
HeatingConvergenceTolerance
```
The convergence tolerance for the unit heating output. This field allows the user some control over how closely the heating coil will control the air side conditions. The relative size of this parameter relates directly to the closeness of the control. A very small value in this field will result in tight control and will probably result in larger numbers of iterations. A large value in this field will result in looser controls and could result in unsatisfactory fluctuations in supply conditions (that could in turn result in excessive iterations). Initial experience with this parameter lends to the recommendation of using 0.001 as a starting point. This field is ignored for gas and electric heating coils.
The unit is controlled by matching the unit output to the zone demand. For units with water coils, the model must be numerically inverted to obtain a specified output. The heating convergence tolerance is the error tolerance used to terminate the numerical inversion procedure. Basically this is the fraction:
\frac{{\left| {{Q_{unit{\kern 1pt} heater,out}} - {Q_{zoneload}}} \right|}}{{{Q_{zoneload}}}} \le HeatingConvergenceTolerance
```
	
##  Field: Availability Manager List Name 
AvailabilityManagerListName
```
This optional input field is the name of an {AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList} object. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this unit heater object's fan. If the unit heater is available (per the Availability Schedule Name input field above) and this input field has a valid availability manager assignment list name, then the availability managers in the list determine when and if the fan of this unit heater object should be on or off.
```
	
##  Field: Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing Object Name 
DesignSpecificationZoneHVACSizingObjectName
```
This optional input field is the name of a {DesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizing} object. The name must correspond to unique name of a {DesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizing} object. A Design Sepcification Zone HVAC Sizing object defines scalable sizing methods for sizing input fields {Maximum Supply Air Flow Rate} in this Unit Heater zone HVAC object. The scaled maximum supply air flow rates is used to size Maximum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate if specified as autosize. The scaled Maximum Air Flow Rate in turn is used to size heating capacity of the unit.
An example input for a unit heater, including its constituent components, is shown below.

# ZoneHVACEvaporativeCoolerUnit

`ZoneHVAC:EvaporativeCoolerUnit`
```
The zone evaporative cooler unit is a compound object made up of a fan and one or two evaporative cooler components.~ This unit serves a single thermal zone as a forced-convection, cooling-only unit with supply fan.~ It always draws 100% of its supply air from the outside, passes the air through a supply fan and evaporative cooler(s) and then into the zone.~ The fan can be positioned upstream of the cooler(s) for a blow through placement.~ Or it can be positioned downstream of the cooler(s) for a draw through placement.~ If there is more than one evaporative cooler, then should be in series with the first cooler immediately upstream of the second cooler. There is an option to include a relief zone exhaust node to balance the air in the zone.
The unit can have either constant or variable speed fans.~ When a constant speed fan is specified and the Cooler Unit Control Method is either {ZoneTemperatureDeadbandOnOffCycling} or {ZoneCoolingLoadOnOffCycling}, this zone unit runs just like other constant speed forced-air zone units in that its controls allow the unit to cycle based on a part-load formulation with averaged air flow rates. When a variable speed fan is specified and the Cooler Unit Control Method is {ZoneCoolingLoadVariableSpeedFan}, then the unit can modulate fan speed to meet cooling loads just like other zone HVAC units with variable speed fan.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field defines a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a zone evaporative cooler unit.~ References to this unit by other objects will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a schedule that denotes whether the unit operates during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0.0 denotes that the cooler unit must be off for that time period. A schedule value greater than 0.0 denotes that the cooler is available to operate during that time period. If this field is left blank, then the program assumes that the unit is always available as if the schedule was always set to 1.0.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Manager List Name 
AvailabilityManagerListName
```
This optional alpha input field is the name of an {AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList} object. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name.~ The availability managers in the list apply to this evaporative cooler unit's operation. If this field is used and the cooler unit is scheduled to be available, based on the previous input field, then the unit will operate based on the result of the availability managers in the list.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name 
OutdoorAirInletNodeName
```
This alpha input field defines the name of the HVAC system node from which the evaporative cooler unit draws its supply air.~ This node is usually declared to be an outdoor air node using {OutdoorAir:Node} or {OutdoorAir:NodeList}.
```
	
##  Field: Cooler Outlet Node Name 
CoolerOutletNodeName
```
This alpha input field defines the name of the HVAC system node to which the evaporative cooler sends its outlet air.~ This node name must be the name of a zone air inlet node (Ref. {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}).
```
	
##  Field: Zone Relief Air Node Name 
ZoneReliefAirNodeName
```
This optional alpha input field defines the name of an HVAC system node which can extract air from the zone to balance the air supplied to the zone by the cooler outlet node.~ This node name would match the name of a zone exhaust air node.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Object Type 
SupplyAirFanObjectType
```
This alpha input field defines the type of fan used by the zone evaporative cooler unit.  There are five valid choices: {Fan:SystemModel}, {Fan:ComponentModel}, {Fan:ConstantVolume}, {Fan:OnOff}, or {Fan:VariableVolume}.  (Note that {Fan:ConstantVolume}, {Fan:OnOff}, and {Fan:VariableVolume} may be deprecated in a future version and as of version 8.7 these are being replaced by {Fan:SystemModel}.)
However the type of fan must be consistent with the control method defined below and a variable speed fan is needed with ZoneCoolingLoadVariableSpeedFan.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Name 
SupplyAirFanName
```
This alpha input field defines the user-defined name of the fan used by this cooler unit. The fan itself is defined elsewhere.~ Note that the fan's maximum flow rate should be greater than or equal to the Design Supply Air Flow Rate defined in the following field.~ For a blow-through fan placement, the fan's inlet node should be the same as the Outlet Air Inlet Node Name. For a draw-through fan placement, the fan's outlet node should be the same as the Cooler Outlet Node Name.
```
	
##  Field: Design Supply Air Flow Rate [m^{3}/s] 
DesignSupplyAirFlowRateM3S
```
This numeric input field defines the evaporative cooler unit's design supply air flow rate, in cubic meters per second.~ This value must be less than or equal to the maximum air flow rate of the fan.
```
	
##  Field: Fan Placement 
FanPlacement
```
This alpha input field defines how the supply fan is arranged.~ There are two choices, BlowThrough or DrawThrough.~ The BlowThrough choice indicates that the fan is located upstream of the evaporative cooler(s). The DrawThrough choice indicates that the fan is located downstream of the evaporative cooler(s). These are the only configurations that are available and the HVAC system nodes used as inlets and outlet in the components must be arranged consistent with the flow path.
```
	
##  Field: Cooler Unit Control Method 
CoolerUnitControlMethod
```
This alpha field is used to determine how the unit is to be controlled.~ There are three possible choices:
  {ZoneTemperatureDeadbandOnOffCycling}. This control method determines whether or not to operate the cooler based on the thermostat setpoint and the zone air temperature.~ This thermostatic control method uses a throttling temperature range, determined in the following input field, to model hysteresis-type control to avoid excessive short-cycling.~ If the zone air temperature is warmer than the cooling setpoint temperature plus one-half of the throttling range, then the unit is operated for the entire timestep at the design air mass flow rate.~ If the zone air temperature is cooler than the cooling setpoint temperature minus one-half of the throttling range, then the unit is off for the entire timestep.~ When the zone air temperatures are within the throttling range, then the unit will stay off if it was not running during the previous timestep and will stay on if it was already running. If the unit is On, then the unit is cycled such that it meets the current cooling load and avoids over-cooling the zone.
  {ZoneCoolingLoadOnOffCycling}. This control method determines whether or not to operate the cooler based on the predicted zone load to cooling setpoint.~ If there is a cooling load (and the unit is available), then the unit is operated for the entire timestep at the design air mass flow rate. If there is no cooling load, then the unit is cycled at the design air mass flow rate such that it meets the current cooling load.~ The magnitude of the cooling load that will trigger the unit to operate can be controlled using the field below called Cooling Load Control Threshold Heat Transfer Rate.
  {ZoneCoolingLoadVariableSpeedFan}.~ This control method determines whether or not to operate the cooler based on the predicted zone load to cooling setpoint.~ If there is a cooling load (and the unit is available), then the unit is operated for the entire timestep at a fan speed that is controlled to meet the sensible cooling load (if possible). The magnitude of the cooling load that will trigger the unit to operate can be controlled using the field below called Cooling Load Control Threshold Heat Transfer Rate.~ This control method requires a variable speed fan and cannot be used with {Fan:ConstantVolume} or {Fan:OnOff}.
```
	
##  Field: Throttling Range Temperature Difference [DeltaC] 
ThrottlingRangeTemperatureDifferenceDeltaC
```
This numeric input field defines the throttling range to use for zone-temperature based control, in degrees Celsius. This value is used when the unit's control method is ZoneTemperatureDeadbandOnOffCycling.~ This temperature range is used for hysteresis thermostatic control.~ It is modeled as symmetric about the cooling setpoint. The default is 1.0{\degreeCelsius}.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Load Control Threshold Heat Transfer Rate [W] 
CoolingLoadControlThresholdHeatTransferRateW
```
This numeric input field defines the magnitude, in Watts, of a significant zone cooling load to use with zone-load-to-setpoint based control.~ This value is used when the unit's control method is ZoneCoolingLoadOnOffCycling or ZoneCoolingLoadVariableSpeedFan.~ This is a sensible cooling load that is used as a threshold to determine when the cooling load is significant.~ When the predicted zone load to cooling setpoint is less than this threshold, the cooler unit's control will consider the load to be too small to trigger operation. The default is 100W.
```
	
##  Field: First Evaporative Cooler Object Type 
FirstEvaporativeCoolerObjectType
```
This alpha input field defines the type of evaporative cooler used in the unit. The zone evaporative cooler unit can have one or two separate cooler components and this field is for the first cooler. There are five types of evaporative cooler component models to choose from: {EvaporativeCooler:Direct:CelDekPad}, {EvaporativeCooler:Direct:ResearchSpecial}, {EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:CelDekPad}, {EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:WetCoil}, or {EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:ResearchSpecial}.
```
	
##  Field: First Evaporative Cooler Object Name 
FirstEvaporativeCoolerObjectName
```
This alpha input field defines the user-defined name of the first evaporative cooler component used by this zone unit.~ The cooler component itself is defined elsewhere. For a blow through fan placement, the inlet node for the evaporative cooler should be the same as the fan's outlet node.~ For a draw through fan placement, the inlet node for the evaporative cooler should be the same as the unit's Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name.
```
	
##  Field: Second Evaporative Cooler Object Type 
SecondEvaporativeCoolerObjectType
```
This optional alpha input field defines the type of evaporative cooler used in the unit. This field is used when the zone evaporative cooler unit has two separate evaporative cooler sections arranged in series. For example, some coolers are arranged with both direct and indirect evaporative coolers. If the unit has only one type of cooler, this field should be left blank. There are five types of evaporative cooler component models to choose from: {EvaporativeCooler:Direct:CelDekPad}, {EvaporativeCooler:Direct:ResearchSpecial}, {EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:CelDekPad}, {EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:WetCoil}, or {EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:ResearchSpecial}
```
	
##  Field: Second Evaporative Cooler Name 
SecondEvaporativeCoolerName
```
This optional alpha input field defines the user-defined name of the second evaporative cooler component used by this zone unit.~ The cooler component itself is defined elsewhere. The inlet node for the second evaporative cooler should be the same as the outlet node for the first evaporative cooler.~ For a draw through fan placement, the outlet node for the second evaporative cooler should be the same as the unit's fan inlet node.
```
	
##  Field: Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing Object Name 
DesignSpecificationZoneHVACSizingObjectName
```
This optional input field is the name of a {DesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizing} object. The name must correspond to unique name of a {DesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizing} object defined elsewhere. A Design Sepcification Zone HVAC Sizing object defines scalable sizing methods for sizing input field {Design Supply Air Flow Rate} in Evaportaive Cooler zone HVAC object. The scaled design supply air flow rates in turn is used to size capacity of the unit.
An example input object follows.

# ZoneHVACOutdoorAirUnit

`ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit`
```
The zone outdoor air unit (ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit) in EnergyPlus is intended to model dedicated outdoor air systems (DOAS) and other similar systems which aim to provide either additional outside air or some limited amount of sensible and/or latent conditioning.~ The zone outdoor air unit is a piece of zone equipment that can consist of a supply fan, an exhaust fan (optional), heating and cooling coils, and heat recovery.~ The outdoor air unit input simply requires information about flow rates, schedules, node names, and a list of component that are part of the unit.~ These components require additional input as per the requirements for these components.~ In addition, the input includes information about controls for the unit.~ It should be noted that the components that make up the zone outdoor air unit do not require additional controls or setpoints.~ The unit input defines how the unit outlet temperature is controlled as described below.
When an AirloopHVAC serves the same zone, it is strongly recommended that the outdoor and exhaust air flow rates are balanced. In addition, the exhaust airflow rate and air schedule should be the same as outdoor air flow rate and outdoor air schedule, respectively. Otherwise, possible unbalanced flows will cause improper return airflow unless {ZoneAirMassFlowConservation} is active.
The full input for zone outdoor air units is described below using a variety of fields.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This field is simply the identifying name that distinguishes one particular outdoor air unit from another in the input data file. Like all other names in EnergyPlus, it is assumed that this is a unique character string and that no other zone outdoor air units use this same name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This field is a schedule name (ref: Schedule) that determines whether the zone outdoor air unit is available to operate. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the outdoor air unit can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the outdoor air unit must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods. For any schedule value greater than zero, the outdoor air unit is considered available and will operate at the supply and exhaust flow rates defined by input field described below.
```
	
##  Field: Zone Name 
ZoneName
```
This field is the name of the zone (Ref: Zone) in which the outdoor air unit is located and intended to affect.~ Zone outdoor air units impact only a single zone.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Flow Rate 
OutdoorAirFlowRate
```
This field allows the user to enter the volumetric flow rate of outdoor air (in m^{3}/sec) that will be brought in through the outdoor air unit. The actual outdoor air flow rate will be this number multiplied by the schedule value from the outdoor air schedule. This field is autosizable.~ When autosized, the unit's outdoor air flow rate will match the minimum outdoor air requirements specified through the {Sizing:Zone} object.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Schedule Name 
OutdoorAirScheduleName
```
This field contains a schedule name (ref: Schedule) that contains values for modifying the outdoor air flow rate.~ The supply air flow rate is the product of the outdoor air flow rate and the outdoor air schedule value for the time of interest. ~Note that if the outdoor air unit is scheduled off that the system will not operate regardless of the outdoor air schedule value. However, if the system is operating, it will always bring in this fraction of the outdoor air flow rate.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Fan Name 
SupplyFanName
```
This field is the name of a fan (ref: {Fan:SystemModel}, {Fan:ConstantVolume}, {Fan:VariableVolume}) that is part of the zone outdoor air unit. This name links the outdoor air unit to particular fan data entered elsewhere in the input data file. A fan name is required since it is the prime mover of air in the outdoor air control unit.
```
	
##  Field: Fan Placement 
FanPlacement
```
This field has two choices: {BlowThrough} or {DrawThrough}. The first choice stands for ``blow through fan''. It means that the unit consists of outdoor air node followed by a supply fan followed by the equipment that are part of the system. The second choice stands for ``draw through fan''. It means that the supply fan placed at the end of supply air stream and supply fan outlet node is identified with the air outlet node. The fan ``draws air through'' the equipment system.
  BlowThrough
  DrawThrough
If the user does not select a fan placement type, {DrawThrough} is assumed as default by EnergyPlus.
```
	
##  Field: Exhaust Fan Name 
ExhaustFanName
```
This field is the name of a fan (ref: {Fan:SystemModel}, {Fan:ConstantVolume}, {Fan:VariableVolume}) that is part of the outdoor air unit. This name links the outdoor air unit to particular fan data entered elsewhere in the input data file. This field is optional.
```
	
##  Field: Exhaust Air Flow Rate 
ExhaustAirFlowRate
```
This field allows the user to enter the volumetric flow rate of air (in m^{3}/sec) that will be exhausted to the outdoors. The actual exhaust air flow rate will be this number multiplied by the schedule value from the exhaust air schedule. If the exhaust fan name is left blank, this field will be ignored and automatically set to be equal to zero.
```
	
##  Field: Exhaust Air Schedule Name 
ExhaustAirScheduleName
```
This field contains a schedule name (ref: Schedule) that should contain values for modifying the exhaust air flow rate.~ The actual exhaust air flow rate equals the exhaust air flow rate input (previous field) multiplied by the exhaust air schedule value. If the exhaust fan name is left blank, this field will be ignored and automatically set to be equal to zero.
```
	
##  Field: Unit Control Type 
UnitControlType
```
The unit control type field determines with conditions in the zone being served what the response of the zone outdoor air system will be. It is important to note that this only controls the temperature of the air being delivered to the space not whether or not the system will operate.~ There are two options for this field: Neutral or Temperature. Neutral control tries to have no energy impact on the zone by delivering air at the temperature of the zone. This allows air to be delivered to the zone without affecting the zone air heat balance and thus provides outside air without impacting any other system providing conditioning to this zone. The temperature control option will supply air to the zone based on the high and low air control temperature schedules (see next two fields). For temperature control, when the outside air temperature is less than the low air control temperature, the zone outdoor air unit will provide whatever heating is available from its components to achieve the low air temperature value.~ When the outside air temperature is above the high air control temperature, the zone outdoor air unit will provide whatever cooling is available from its components to achieve the high air temperature value.~ When the outdoor air temperature is between the high and low air control temperatures, the unit will simply provide air at whatever the outdoor air conditions are, modified by any fan heat added by the supply fan. In summary, the user must select from the following two options:
  NeutralControl
  TemperatureControl
If the user does not select a unit control type, {NeutralControl} is assumed as the default by EnergyPlus.
```
	
##  Field: High Air Control Temperature Schedule Name 
HighAirControlTemperatureScheduleName
```
This field specifies the dry-bulb air temperature in degrees Celsius for the supply air temperature to the zone. When the outdoor air temperature or post-supply fan outlet temperature in the case of blow through is above the high air control temperature, a cooling coil, if available and specified by the user, is tuned on to conditioning the outdoor air to the high control temperature. This field only applies to zone outdoor air units that use Temperature Control (see previous field).
```
	
##  Field: Low Air Control Temperature Schedule Name 
LowAirControlTemperatureScheduleName
```
This field specifies the dry-bulb air temperature in degrees Celsius for the supply air temperature to the zone. When the outdoor air temperature or post-supply fan outlet temperature is below the low air control temperature, a heating coil, if available and specified by the user, is tuned on to conditioning the outdoor air to the low control temperature. This field only applies to zone outdoor air units that use Temperature Control (see two previous fields).
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Node Name 
OutdoorAirNodeName
```
This field is a node name used to identify the node associated with fresh air brought into the outdoor air unit from the outdoor environment. It should also be defined in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object with the same name and assigned an optional height (above ground).
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName
```
This field is a node name used to identify the node that serves as the outlet (air side) from the zone outdoor air unit. In EnergyPlus, nodes represent points between components or at various points in the loops. In an outdoor air unit, the air outlet node from the system will typically be the same node as a zone inlet node. While a node name may be referenced more than once in an input data file, each node must have a unique name.
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
This field is a node name used to identify the node that serves as the inlet (air side) to the exhaust side of the outdoor air unit. In EnergyPlus, nodes represent points between components or at various points in the loops. In an outdoor air unit, the air inlet node of the system will typically be the same node as a zone outlet node. While a node name may be referenced more than once in an input data file, each node must have a unique name.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Fan Outlet Node Name 
SupplyFanOutletNodeName
```
This field is a node name used to identify the node that serves as the outlet (air side) of the supply fan for the zone outdoor air unit. In EnergyPlus, nodes represent points between components or at various points in the loops. While a node name may be referenced more than once in an input data file, each node must have a unique name.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Unit List Name 
OutdoorAirUnitListName
```
This field is the name of an {ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit:EquipmentList} object. An {ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit:EquipmentList} ~is simply a list of components giving both component name and type. This equipment list specifies all the components that will be simulated in this unit. The order of the components in the list is significant: components are simulated sequentially in the order given in the Equipment List.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Manager List Name 
AvailabilityManagerListName
```
This optional input field is the name of an {AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList} object. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this outdoor air unit~ object's fan. If the outdoor air unit is available (per the Availability Schedule Name input field above) and this input field has a valid availability manager assignment list name, then the availability managers in the list determine when and if the fan of this outdoor air unit~ object should be on or off.
An example of this object defined in an input data file is shown below{:}

# ZoneHVACWindowAirConditioner

`ZoneHVAC:WindowAirConditioner`
```
The Window Air Conditioner is a unit of zone equipment made up of other components. Each window air conditioner consists of an outdoor air mixer, a fan, and a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil. These components are described elsewhere in this document. The input for a window air conditioner requires the names of these three pieces of equipment, which are then specified individually elsewhere in the input. The input for a window air conditioner also requires the name of an availability schedule, the maximum unit airflow rate, and the maximum outdoor airflow rate for the unit. The unit is connected to a zone by specifying an air inlet node, which must be the same as a zone exhaust node; and an air outlet node, which must be the same as a zone inlet node (ref. {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}).
A supply air fan operating mode schedule must also be specified. The supply air fan operating mode schedule value determines if the supply air fan can run continuously with the DX coil cycling on/off to match the zone cooling demand or the fan and DX coil can cycle on/off together to meet the cooling demand. The placement of the supply air fan, in relation to the DX coil, must also be specified (blow through or draw through). The cooling convergence tolerance is required, which is the tolerance denoting how closely the window air conditioner will meet the cooling load. The tolerance is always relative to the zone load (i.e., the unit will operate to meet the zone load to within the tolerance value times the zone load for each simulation timestep). Finally, the DX cooling coil type must be specified.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
A unique user assigned name for an instance of a window air conditioner unit. Any reference to this window air conditioner by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the window air conditioner unit can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Supply Air Flow Rate 
MaximumSupplyAirFlowRate
```
The maximum volumetric airflow rate through the window air conditioner in cubic meters per second. Since the unit operates by cycling on/off, this is also the design, rated airflow rate of the unit.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Outdoor Air Flow Rate 
MaximumOutdoorAirFlowRate
```
If the window air conditioner uses outdoor air, this field specifies the outdoor air volumetric flow rate in cubic meters per second. This flow rate should be less than or equal to the maximum airflow rate. A value of zero specifies no outdoor air. Note that the outdoor airflow rate is fixed: it cannot change during the simulation
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
The name of the HVAC system node (see Node) from which the window air conditioner draws its indoor air. This should be one of the zone exhaust nodes for the zone which the window air conditioner is cooling.
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name

```
The name of the HVAC system node (see Node) to which the window air conditioner sends its outlet air. This should be one of the inlet air nodes for the zone which is being cooled.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Mixer Object Type 
OutdoorAirMixerObjectType
```
This field specifies the type of outdoor air mixer used by this window air conditioner unit. The outdoor air mixer component is part of the window air conditioner compound object. The only available outdoor air mixer type is:
{OutdoorAir:Mixer}
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Mixer Name 
OutdoorAirMixerName
```
The name of an outdoor air mixer component which composes part of the window air conditioner unit. Note that the return air node of the outdoor air mixer should be the same node as the air inlet node of the window air conditioner. In addition, the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node should be the same as the window air conditioner's fan inlet air node (for blow through) or the air conditioner's DX coil inlet node (for draw through)
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Object Type 
SupplyAirFanObjectType
```
This field specifies the type of supply air fan used by window air conditioner. The supply air fan is part of the window air conditioner compound object. The only valid supply air fan types are:
  {Fan:SystemModel}
  {Fan:OnOff}
  {Fan:ConstantVolume}
Note that {Fan:SystemModel} was added as of version 8.7 and is recommended for use in new models.  {Fan:OnOff} and {Fan:ConstantVolume}may be deprecated in a future version.
```
	
##  Field:Supply Air Fan Name 
SupplyAirFanName
```
The name of the fan component that composes part of the window air conditioner. Note that the fan's maximum flow rate should be the same as the maximum airflow rate of the window air conditioner. A fan of type {Fan:SystemModel} or {Fan:OnOff} may be used with either cycling or continuous fan, and a fan of type {Fan:ConstantVolume} is used only with continuous fan (see Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule field below). The fan's inlet node should be the same as the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node (for blow through) or the DX coil's outlet node (for draw through). The fan's outlet node should be the same as the DX coil's air inlet node (for blow through) or the window air conditioner's air outlet node (for draw through).
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Coil Object Type 
CoolingCoilObjectType
```
This field specifies the type of cooling coil to be modeled for this window air conditioner. The input requirements for these cooling coil objects are described elsewhere in this document. If the user wants to control the enhanced dehumidification performance of the Heat Exchanger Assisted coil type based on zone air humidity level, then the input file must include a humidistat object (ref. {ZoneControl:Humidistat}) for the zone being served by this air conditioner and a high humidity set point manager (ref. {SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum}) with the high humidity set point placed on the outlet node of the heat exchanger assisted cooling coil. Only allowable coil types are:
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed}
  {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted}
```
	
##  Field: DX Cooling Coil Name 
DXCoolingCoilName
```
The name of a DX cooling coil component that composes part of the window air conditioner unit. The DX coil air inlet node should be the same as the fan outlet node (for blow through) or the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node (for draw through). The DX coil air outlet node should be the same as the window air conditioner's air outlet node (for blow through) or the fan's inlet node (for draw through).
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name 
SupplyAirFanOperatingModeScheduleName
```
This alpha field specifies the name of the supply air fan operating mode schedule. The supply air fan operating mode may vary during the simulation based on time-of-day or with a change of season. Schedule values of 0 denote that the supply air fan and the heating or cooling coil cycle on and off together to meet the heating or cooling load (a.k.a. AUTO fan). Schedule values other than 0 denote that the supply air fan runs continuously while the heating or cooling coil cycles to meet the load. If this field is left blank, the model assumes the supply air fan cycles with the heating or cooling coil throughout the simulation.
```
	
##  Field: Fan Placement 
FanPlacement
```
This input field has two choices: {BlowThrough} or {DrawThrough}. The first choice stands for ``blow through fan''. This means that the unit consists of an outdoor air mixer followed by a fan followed by a DX coil. The fan ``blows through'' the DX coil. The second choice stands for ``draw through fan''. This means that the unit consists of an outdoor air mixer followed by a DX coil followed by a fan. The fan ``draws air through'' the coil.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Convergence Tolerance 
CoolingConvergenceTolerance
```
This input field defines the convergence tolerance for the unit's cooling output. This field allows the user some control over how closely the air conditioner will control the air-side conditions. The relative size of this parameter relates directly to the closeness of the control. A very small value in this field will result in tight control and will probably result in larger numbers of iterations. A large value in this field will result in looser controls and could result in unsatisfactory fluctuations in zone air temperature. Initial experience with this parameter lends to the recommendation of using 0.001 as the starting point.
The window air conditioner is controlled by matching its sensible (temperature) cooling output to the zone sensible load (demand). Because the performance of the DX coil is frequently non-linear, the air conditioner model must call the DX coil model several times (iterate) to determine the proper run time fraction to meet the zone load. The cooling convergence tolerance is the error tolerance used to terminate the iteration procedure when the following equation is satisfied:
\frac{{\left| {{Q_{ZoneLoad}} - {Q_{WindowAirConditioner,out}})} \right|}}{{{Q_{ZoneLoad}}}} \le Cooling{\kern 1pt} Convergence{\kern 1pt} Tolerance
The maximum number of iterations is limited, with a warning message generated if the above equation is not satisfied within the maximum number of iterations.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Manager List Name 
AvailabilityManagerListName
```
This optional input field is the name of an {AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList} object. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this window air conditioner or object's fan. If the window air conditioner is available (per the Availability Schedule Name input field above) and this input field has a valid availability manager assignment list name, then the availability managers in the list determine when and if the fan of this window air conditioner object should be on or off.
```
	
##  Field: Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing Object Name 
DesignSpecificationZoneHVACSizingObjectName
```
This optional input field is the name of a {DesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizing} object. The name must correspond to unique name of a {DesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizing} object. A Design Sepcification Zone HVAC Sizing object defines scalable sizing methods for sizing input fields such as Maximum Air Flow Rate in this Window Air Conditioner zone HVAC object. The scaled Maximum Air Flow Rate in turn is used to size cooling capacity of the unit.
Following is an example input for the cycling window air conditioner, along with its constituent components.

# ZoneHVACPackagedTerminalAirConditioner

`ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalAirConditioner`
```
The packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) is a compound object made up of other components. Each PTAC consists of an outdoor air mixer, direct expansion (DX) cooling coil, heating coil (gas, electric, hot water, or steam) and a supply air fan. While the figure below shows the PTAC with draw through fan placement, blow through fan placement can also be modeled by positioning the supply air fan between the outdoor air mixer and the DX cooling coil. The packaged terminal air conditioner coordinates the operation of these components and is modeled as a type of zone equipment (Ref. {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList} and {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}).
Links to the PTAC's supply air fan, DX cooling coil, heating coil, and outdoor air mixer specifications are provided in the air conditioner's input syntax. Additional inputs include supply and outdoor air flow rates during cooling operation, heating operation, and when neither cooling or heating is required. A description of each input field for the packaged terminal air conditioner compound object is provided below.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field defines a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a packaged terminal air conditioner. Any reference to this air conditioner by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the air conditioner operates during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the air conditioner must be off for that time period. A value greater than 0 denotes that the air conditioner is available to operate during that time period. This schedule may be used to completely disable the air conditioner (all of its coils and the supply air fan) as required. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node from which the air conditioner draws its inlet air. This node name must be either the name of a zone air exhaust node (Ref. {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}) to draw air from a zone directly or the name of an induced air outlet node (Ref. {AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenum}) to draw air from a return plenum, when the zone return node is connected to a return plenum.
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName

```
This field specifies the type of outdoor air mixer used by this PTAC. The outdoor air mixer component is part of the PTAC unit. The only available outdoor air mixer type is:
  {OutdoorAir:Mixer}
This input field should be left blank when the PTAC is connected to an {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object. If this field is left blank, an outdoor air mixer object is not simulated.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Mixer Name 
OutdoorAirMixerName
```
This alpha field defines the name of an outdoor air mixer component which composes part of the PTAC. The return air node of the outdoor air mixer should also be the same node as the air inlet node of the PTAC. Furthermore, the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node should be the same as the PTAC's fan inlet air node (for blow through fan placement) or the PTAC's DX cooling coil inlet node (for draw through fan placement). This field should be left blank when the PTAC is connected to an {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Supply Air Flow Rate 
CoolingSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the air conditioner in cubic meters per second when the DX cooling coil is operating. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Supply Air Flow Rate 
HeatingSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the air conditioner in cubic meters per second when the heating coil is operating. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: No Load Supply Air Flow Rate 
NoLoadSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the air conditioner in cubic meters per second when neither cooling nor heating is required (i.e., DX coil and heater are off but the supply air fan operates). This field is only used when the air conditioner's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation. Values must be greater than or equal to zero, or this field is autosizable. If the air conditioner's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation and this value is set to zero or this field is left blank, then the model assumes that the supply air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is equal to the supply air flow rate when the cooling or heating coil was last operating (for cooling operation or heating operation).
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate 
CoolingOutdoorAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the air conditioner in cubic meters per second when the DX cooling coil is operating. Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate is fixed; it cannot change during the simulation. In addition, the Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate cannot be greater than the air conditioner's supply air volumetric flow rate during cooling operation. This field is set to zero flow when the PTAC is connected to an {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate 
HeatingOutdoorAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the air conditioner in cubic meters per second when the heating coil is operating.

This field is set to zero flow when the PTAC is connected to an {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object.
```
	
##  Field: No Load Outdoor Air Flow Rate 
NoLoadOutdoorAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the air conditioner in cubic meters per second when neither cooling nor heating is required (i.e., cooling and heating coils are off but the supply air fan operates). Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the outdoor air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is fixed; it cannot change during the simulation. In addition, the outdoor air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed cannot be greater than the air conditioner's supply air volumetric flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed. This field is only used when the air conditioner's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation. If the air conditioner's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation and the field `Supply air volumetric flow rate when no cooling or heating is needed' is set to zero or is left blank, then the model assumes that the outdoor air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is equal to the outdoor air flow rate when the cooling or heating coil was last operating (for cooling operation [i.e., Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate] or heating operation [i.e., Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate]) and this field is not used. This input field is set to zero flow when the PTAC is connected to an {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Object Type 
SupplyAirFanObjectType
```
This alpha field defines the type of fan used by this PTAC. The only valid choices are {{Fan:SystemModel}}, {{Fan:OnOff}}, and {{Fan:ConstantVolume}}.

The input requirements for these fan objects are described elsewhere in this document. Note that {Fan:SystemModel} was added as of version 8.7 and is recommended for use in new models.  {Fan:OnOff} and {Fan:ConstantVolume} may be deprecated in a future version.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Name 
SupplyAirFanName
```
The name of a constant volume fan component that composes part of the PTAC. Note that the fan's maximum flow rate should be greater than or equal to the maximum supply air flow rate for the PTAC. The fan's inlet node should be the same as the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node (for blow through fan placement) or the heating coil's outlet node (for draw through fan placement). The fan's outlet node should be the same as the DX cooling coil's air inlet node (for blow through fan placement) or the PTAC's air outlet node (for draw through fan placement).
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Object Type 
HeatingCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field defines the type of heating coil to be used by this PTAC. The input requirements for this heating coil object are described elsewhere in this document. The hot water flow modulation through the heating coil does not require additional controller or {Controller:WaterCoil} object. The parent object (PTAC) itself provides the ``controller'' function of modulating water flow. Allowable heating coil types are:
  {Coil:Heating:Water}
  {Coil:Heating:Electric}
  {Coil:Heating:Fuel}
  {Coil:Heating:Steam}

```
	
##  Field: Fan Placement 
FanPlacement
```
This alpha field has two choices: {BlowThrough} or {DrawThrough}. The first choice stands for ``blow through fan''. This means that the unit consists of an outdoor air mixer followed by a fan followed by the DX cooling coil and heating coil. The fan ``blows through'' the DX cooling coil and the heating coil. The second choice stands for ``draw through fan''. This means that the unit consists of an outdoor air mixer followed by the DX cooling coil and heating coil with the fan located at the outlet of the PTAC. The fan ``draws air through'' the DX cooling coil and the heating coil. If this field is left blank, the default is draw through.
Note: the packaged terminal air conditioner's supply air fan, cooling coil and heating coil must be connected according to the configuration shown above (Figure{fig:schematic-of-a-packaged-terminal-air-001}) for the draw through fan configuration. The only other valid configuration is with a blow through fan placement, where the fan is located between the outdoor air mixer and the DX cooling coil.

This alpha field specifies the name of the supply air fan operating mode schedule. The supply air fan operating mode may vary during the simulation based on time-of-day or with a change of season. Schedule values of 0 denote that the supply air fan and the heating or cooling coil cycle on and off together to meet the heating or cooling load (a.k.a. AUTO fan). Schedule values other than 0 denote that the supply fan runs continuously while the heating or cooling coil cycles to meet the load.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Manager List Name 
AvailabilityManagerListName
```
This optional input field is the name of an {AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList} object. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this packaged terminal air conditioner or object's fan. If the packaged terminal air conditioner is available (per the Availability Schedule Name input field above) and this input field has a valid availability manager assignment list name, then the availability managers in the list determine when and if the fan of this packaged terminal air conditioner object should be on or off.
```
	
##  Field: Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing Object Name 
DesignSpecificationZoneHVACSizingObjectName
```
This optional input field is the name of a {DesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizing} object. The name must correspond to unique name of a {DesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizing} object. A Design Sepcification Zone HVAC Sizing object defines scalable sizing methods for sizing input fields such as Cooling Supply Air Flow Rate in this Packaged Terminal Air Conditioner~ zone HVAC object. The scaled Supply Air Flow Rate in turn is used to size cooling and heating capacity of the unit.
```
	
##  Field: Capacity Control Method 
CapacityControlMethod
```
This input denotes how the unit's output is controlled in order to meet zone heating or cooling requirement. The choices are {{None}} or {{SingleZoneVAV}}. For {None}, the unit varies the fan and/or coil speed to meet the load. If constant fan operating mode is selected the fan operates at the design cooling or heating air flow rate while the coil modulates to meet the load. If cycling fan operating mode is selected the fan and coil modulate in unison to meet the load. For {SingleZoneVAV}, the fan air flow rate is reduced to the no load supply air flow rate when the zone sensible load is low such that the maximum supply air temperature limit is not exceeded. If the unit cannot meet the load at this lower air flow rate, the fan speed increases while maintaining the maximum supply air temperature. If the unit still cannot meet the load the unit will operate at the maximum supply air flow rate and the maximum supply air temperature limit can be exceeded. Supply air temperature limits are identified in the input fields for Minimum Supply Air Temperature in Cooling Mode and Maximum Supply Air Temperature in Heating Mode. Additionally, specific coil types are required for the SingleZoneVAV capacity control method. The cooling coil type is {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed} while the heating coil types are {Coil:Heating:Water}, {Coil:Heating:Fuel} and {Coil:Heating:Electric}. If alternate coil types are used they are modeled using the load based control method.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Supply Air Temperature in Cooling Mode 
MinimumSupplyAirTemperatureInCoolingMode
```
When Capacity Control Method = SingleZoneVAV, enter the minimum air temperature limit for reduced fan speed in cooling mode. For SingleZoneVAV, this field's minimum supply air temperature is 0.0{\degreeCelsius}. This field is autosizable and the default is autosize.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Supply Air Temperature in Heating Mode 
MaximumSupplyAirTemperatureInHeatingMode
```
When Capacity Control Method = SingleZoneVAV, enter the maximum air temperature limit for reduced fan speed in heating mode. For SingleZoneVAV, this field's minimum supply air temperature is 0.0{\degreeCelsius}. This field is autosizable and the default is autosize.
As shown in the example below, correct specification of the packaged terminal air conditioner requires the following objects in addition to the compound object itself:

# ZoneHVACPackagedTerminalHeatPump

`ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump`
```
The packaged terminal heat pump (PTHP) is a compound object made up of other components. Each PTHP consists of an outdoor air mixer, direct expansion (DX) cooling coil, DX heating coil, supply air fan, and a supplemental heating coil as shown in the figure below. These individual components are described elsewhere in this document. The packaged terminal heat pump coordinates the operation of these components and is modeled as a type of zone equipment (Ref. {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList} and {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}).
Links to the PTHP's supply air fan, DX coils, supplemental heating coil, and outdoor air mixer specifications are provided in the heat pump's input syntax. Additional inputs include supply and outdoor air flow rates during cooling operation, heating operation, and when neither cooling or heating is required. A description of each input field for the packaged terminal heat pump compound object is provided below.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
This alpha field defines a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a packaged terminal heat pump. Any reference to this heat pump by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the heat pump operates during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the heat pump must be off for that time period. A value greater than 0 denotes that the heat pump is available to operate during that time period. This schedule may be used to completely disable the heat pump (all of its coils and the supply air fan) as required. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node from which the heat pump draws its inlet air. This node name must be either the name of a zone air exhaust node (Ref. {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}) to draw air from a zone directly or the name of an induced air outlet node (Ref. {AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenum}) to draw air from a return plenum, when the zone return node is connected to a return plenum.
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node to which the heat pump sends its outlet air. This node name must be the name of a zone air inlet node (Ref. {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}).
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Mixer Object Type 
OutdoorAirMixerObjectType
```
This field specifies the type of outdoor air mixer used by this PTHP. The outdoor air mixer component is part of the PTHP compound object. The only available outdoor air mixer type is:
  {OutdoorAir:Mixer}
This input field should be left blank when the PTHP is connected to an {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object. If this field is left blank, an outdoor air mixer object is not simulated.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Mixer Name 
OutdoorAirMixerName
```
This alpha field defines the name of an outdoor air mixer component which composes part of the PTHP. Note that the return air node of the outdoor air mixer should also be the same node as the air inlet node of the PTHP. Furthermore, the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node should be the same as the PTHP's fan inlet air node (for blow through fan placement) or the PTHP's DX cooling coil inlet node (for draw through fan placement). This field should be left blank when the PTHP is connected to an {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Supply Air Flow Rate 
CoolingSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX cooling coil is operating. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Supply Air Flow Rate 
HeatingSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX heating coil and/or supplemental heater are operating. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: No Load Supply Air Flow Rate 
NoLoadSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when neither cooling or heating is required (i.e., DX coils and supplemental heater are off but the supply air fan operates). This field is only used when the heat pump's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation. Values must be greater than or equal to zero, or this field is autosizable. If the heat pump's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation and this value is set to zero or this field is left blank, then the model assumes that the supply air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is equal to the supply air flow rate when the cooling or heating coil was last operating (for cooling operation or heating operation).
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate 
CoolingOutdoorAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX cooling coil is operating. Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate is fixed; it cannot change during the simulation. In addition, the Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate cannot be greater than the heat pump's supply air volumetric flow rate during cooling operation.
This field is set to zero flow when the PTHP is connected to an {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate 
HeatingOutdoorAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX heating coil and/or supplemental heater are operating. Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate is fixed; it cannot change during the simulation. In addition, the Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate cannot be greater than the heat pump's supply air volumetric flow rate during heating operation. This field is set to zero flow when the PTHP is connected to an {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object.
```
	
##  Field: No Load Outdoor Air Flow Rate 
NoLoadOutdoorAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the heat pump in cubic meters per second when neither cooling or heating is required (i.e., DX coils and supplemental heater are off but the supply air fan operates). Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the outdoor air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is fixed; it cannot change during the simulation. In addition, the outdoor air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed cannot be greater than the heat pump's supply air volumetric flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed. This field is only used when the heat pump's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation. If the heat pump's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation and the field `Supply air volumetric flow rate when no cooling or heating is needed' is set to zero or is left blank, then the model assumes that the outdoor air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is equal to the outdoor air flow rate when the cooling or heating coil was last operating (for cooling operation [i.e., Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate] or heating operation [i.e., Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate]) and this field is not used. This field is set to zero flow when the heat pump is connected to an {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Object Type 
SupplyAirFanObjectType
```
This alpha field defines the type of fan used by this PTHP. The only valid choices are {Fan:OnOff} and {Fan:ConstantVolume}. A fan of type {Fan:OnOff} may be used with either cycling or continuous fan operating mode, and a fan of type {Fan:ConstantVolume} is used only with continuous fan operating mode (see Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule field below). The input requirements for these fan objects are described elsewhere in this document.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Name 
SupplyAirFanName
```
The name of a constant volume fan component that composes part of the PTHP. Note that the fan's maximum flow rate should be greater than or equal to the maximum supply air flow rate for the PTHP. The fan's inlet node should be the same as the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node (for blow through fan placement) or the DX heating coil's outlet node (for draw through fan placement). The fan's outlet node should be the same as the DX cooling coil's air inlet node (for blow through fan placement) or the supplemental heater's air inlet node (for draw through fan placement).
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Object Type 
HeatingCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field defines the type of DX heating coil to be used by this PTHP. The only valid choice are {{Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed}} and {{Coil:Heating:DX:VariableSpeed}}. The input requirements for this DX heating coil object are described elsewhere in this document.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Coil Name 
HeatingCoilName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the DX heating coil used by this PTHP, and this name should match the name specified in the corresponding DX heating coil object.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Convergence Tolerance 
HeatingConvergenceTolerance
```
This numeric field defines the convergence tolerance for the unit's heating output. This field allows the user some control over how closely the heat pump will control the air-side conditions. The relative size of this parameter relates directly to the closeness of the control. A very small value in this field will result in tight control and will probably result in larger numbers of iterations. A large value in this field will result in looser controls and could result in unsatisfactory fluctuations in zone air temperature. Initial experience with this parameter lends to the recommendation of using 0.001 as the starting point.
The heat pump is controlled by matching its sensible (temperature) heating output to the zone sensible load (demand). Because the performance of the DX heating coil is frequently non-linear, the heat pump model must call the DX heating coil model several times (iterate) to determine the proper run time fraction to meet the zone load. The heating convergence tolerance is the error tolerance used to terminate the iteration procedure when the following equation is satisfied:
\frac{{\left| {({Q_{ZoneLoad}} - {Q_{HeatPump,out}})} \right|}}{{{Q_{ZoneLoad}}}}   \le   Heating{\kern 1pt} Convergence{\kern 1pt} Tolerance
The maximum number of iterations is limited, with a warning message generated if the above equation is not satisfied within the maximum number of iterations.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Coil Object Type 
CoolingCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field defines the type of DX cooling coil used by this PTHP. The input requirements for these DX cooling coil objects are described elsewhere in this document. Only allowable coil types are:
  {Coil:Cooling:DX}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed}
  {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted}
  {Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed}
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Coil Name 
CoolingCoilName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the cooling coil used by this PTHP, and this name should match the name specified in the corresponding DX cooling coil object.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Convergence Tolerance 
CoolingConvergenceTolerance
```
This numeric field defines the convergence tolerance for the unit's cooling output. This field allows the user some control over how closely the heat pump will control the air-side conditions. The relative size of this parameter relates directly to the closeness of the control. A very small value in this field will result in tight control and will probably result in larger numbers of iterations. A large value in this field will result in looser controls and could result in unsatisfactory fluctuations in zone air temperature. Initial experience with this parameter lends to the recommendation of using 0.001 as the starting point.
The heat pump is controlled by matching its sensible (temperature) cooling output to the zone sensible load (demand). Because the performance of the DX cooling coil is frequently non-linear, the heat pump model must call the DX cooling coil model several times (iterate) to determine the proper run time fraction to meet the zone load. The cooling convergence tolerance is the error tolerance used to terminate the iteration procedure when the following equation is satisfied:
\frac{{\left| {({Q_{ZoneLoad}} - {Q_{HeatPump,out}})} \right|}}{{{Q_{ZoneLoad}}}}   \le   Cooling{\kern 1pt} Convergence{\kern 1pt} Tolerance
The maximum number of iterations is limited, with a warning message generated if the above equation is not satisfied within the maximum number of iterations.
```
	
##  Field: Supplemental Heating Coil Object Type 
SupplementalHeatingCoilObjectType
```
This alpha field defines the type of supplemental heating coil to be used by this PTHP. The input requirements for these heating coil objects are described elsewhere in this document. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connector objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the supplemental heating coil does not require additional controller or {Controller:WaterCoil} object. The parent object (PTHP) itself provides the ``controller'' function of modulating water flow. Allowable coil types are:
  {Coil:Heating:Electric}
  {Coil:Heating:Fuel}
  {Coil:Heating:Water}
  {Coil:Heating:Steam}
```
	
##  Field: Supplemental Heating Coil Name 
SupplementalHeatingCoilName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the supplemental heating coil used by this PTHP, and this name should match the name specified in the corresponding heating coil object.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Supply Air Temperature from Supplemental Heater 
MaximumSupplyAirTemperatureFromSupplementalHeater
```
This numeric field defines the maximum supply air temperature in degrees Celsius exiting the heat pump supplemental heater coil. The supplemental heater will be controlled so that its supply air temperature does not exceed this value. This field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Supplemental Heater Operation 
MaximumOutdoorDryBulbTemperatureForSupplementalHeaterOperation
```
This numeric field defines the maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature in degrees Celsius for PTHP supplemental heater operation. The supplemental heater will not operate when the outdoor dry-bulb temperature is above this value. The maximum value must be less than or equal to 21{\degreeCelsius}. If this field is left blank, the default value is 21{\degreeCelsius}.
```
	
##  Field: Fan Placement 
FanPlacement
```
This alpha field has two choices: {BlowThough} or {DrawThrough}. The first choice stands for ``blow through fan''. This means that the unit consists of an outdoor air mixer followed by a fan followed by the DX coils and supplemental heating coil. The fan ``blows through'' the cooling and heating coils. The second choice stands for ``draw through fan''. This means that the unit consists of an outdoor air mixer followed by the DX coil(s) followed by a fan, with the supplemental heater located at the outlet of the fan. The fan ``draws air through'' the DX coil(s). If this field is left blank, the default is draw through.
Note: the packaged terminal heat pump's supply air fan, cooling coil, heating coil and supplementary heating coil must be connected according to the configuration shown above (Figure{fig:schematic-of-a-packaged-terminal-heat-pump-001}) for the draw through fan configuration. The only other valid configuration is with a blow through fan placement, where the fan is located between the outdoor air mixer and the DX cooling coil.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name 
SupplyAirFanOperatingModeScheduleName
```
This alpha field specifies the name of the supply air fan operating mode schedule. The supply air fan operating mode may vary during the simulation based on time-of-day or with a change of season. Schedule values of 0 denote that the supply air fan and the heating or cooling coil cycle on and off together to meet the heating or cooling load (a.k.a. AUTO fan). Schedule values other than 0 denote that the supply air fan runs continuously while the heating or cooling coil cycles to meet the load. If this field is left blank, the model assumes the supply air fan cycles with the heating or cooling coil throughout the simulation.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Manager List Name 
AvailabilityManagerListName
```
This optional input field is the name of an {AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList} object. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this packaged terminal heat pump or object's fan. If the packaged terminal heat pump is available (per the Availability Schedule Name input field above) and this input field has a valid availability manager assignment list name, then the availability managers in the list determine when and if the fan of this packaged terminal heat pump object should be on or off.
```
	
##  Field: Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing Object Name 
DesignSpecificationZoneHVACSizingObjectName
```
This optional input field is the name of a {DesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizing} object. The name must correspond to unique name of a {DesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizing} object. A Design Sepcification Zone HVAC Sizing object defines scalable sizing methods for sizing input fields such as Cooling Supply Air Flow Rate in this PTHP zone HVAC object. The scaled Supply Air Flow Rate in turn is used to size cooling and heating capacity of the unit.
```
	
##  Field: Capacity Control Method 
CapacityControlMethod
```
This input denotes how the unit's output is controlled in order to meet zone heating or cooling requirement. The choices are {{None}} or {{SingleZoneVAV}}. For {None}, the unit varies the fan and/or coil speed to meet the load. If constant fan operating mode is selected the fan operates at the design cooling or heating air flow rate while the coil modulates to meet the load. If cycling fan operating mode is selected the fan and coil modulate in unison to meet the load. For {SingleZoneVAV}, the fan air flow rate is reduced to the no load supply air flow rate when the zone sensible load is low such that the maximum supply air temperature limit is not exceeded. If the unit cannot meet the load at this lower air flow rate, the fan speed increases while maintaining the maximum supply air temperature. If the unit still cannot meet the load the unit will operate at the maximum supply air flow rate and the maximum supply air temperature limit can be exceeded. Supply air temperature limits are identified in the input fields for Minimum Supply Air Temperature in Cooling Mode and Maximum Supply Air Temperature in Heating Mode. Additionally, specific coil types are required for the SingleZoneVAV capacity control method. The cooling coil type is {Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed} while the heating coil type is {Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed}.
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Supply Air Temperature in Cooling Mode 
MinimumSupplyAirTemperatureInCoolingMode
```
When Capacity Control Method = SingleZoneVAV, enter the minimum air temperature limit for reduced fan speed in cooling mode. For SingleZoneVAV, this field's minimum supply air temperature is 0.0{\degreeCelsius}. This field is autosizable and the default is autosize.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Supply Air Temperature in Heating Mode 
MaximumSupplyAirTemperatureInHeatingMode
```
When Capacity Control Method = SingleZoneVAV, enter the maximum air temperature limit for reduced fan speed in heating mode. For SingleZoneVAV, this field's minimum supply air temperature is 0.0{\degreeCelsius}. This field is autosizable and the default is autosize.
As shown in the example below, correct specification of the packaged terminal heat pump requires the following objects in addition to the compound object itself:
  Fan ({Fan:OnOff} or {Fan:ConstantVolume})
  DX cooling coil ({Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed} or {CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted})
  DX heating coil ({Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed})

# ZoneHVACRefrigerationChillerSet

`ZoneHVAC:RefrigerationChillerSet`
```
The ZoneHVAC:RefrigerationChillerSet object works in conjunction with one or multiple air chillers, compressor racks, refrigeration systems, or refrigeration secondary system objects (Ref. {Refrigeration:AirChiller} {Refrigeration:CompressorRack}, {Refrigeration:System}, or {Refrigeration:SecondarySystem}) to simulate the performance of a group of air chillers cooling a single zone. The chiller set model passes information about the zone conditions to determine the performance of individual chiller coils within the set, thus providing the sensible and latent heat exchange with the zone environment.
The refrigeration chiller set object inputs include a name, an availability schedule name, the name of the zone cooled by the chiller set, the air inlet node name, the air outlet node name, and an extensible list of air chiller names (Ref. {Refrigeration:AirChiller}).
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
A unique user-assigned name for an instance of a refrigeration chiller. Any reference to this refrigeration chiller by another object (may be listed in a {Refrigeration:CaseAndWalkInList}, {Refrigeration:System}, {Refrigeration:SecondarySystem}, or {Refrigeration:CompressorRack}) will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the refrigeration chiller can operate during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (maximum schedule value of 1.0 is typically used) indicates that the refrigeration chiller will operate during a given time period. A value equal to 0 denotes that the case does not operate (everything is OFF: refrigeration, fans, lights, anti-sweat, etc.). Typically the refrigeration chiller will operate throughout the day (i.e., the schedule will contain 1 for all time periods); however, refrigeration chillers require maintenance and/or cleaning and this can be modeled accordingly using this schedule if desired. If this field is left blank, the default schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.
```

# ZoneHVACWaterToAirHeatPump

`ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump`
```
The zone water-to-air heat pump is a compound component consisting of a fan, water-to-air cooling and heating coils, and a supplemental heating coil. Links to the fan, WaterToAirHeatPump cooling coil, WaterToAirHeatPump heating coil, and supplementary heating coil specifications are provided in the heat pump's input data syntax. The heat pump switches between cooling and heating depending on the zone's demand. The load side (air) of the zone water-to-air heat pump consists of an On/Off fan component, a WaterToAirHeatPump cooling coil component, a WaterToAirHeatPump heating coil component, and a Gas or Electric supplemental heating coil component. The source side (water) of the heat pump is connected to a condenser loop with a heat exchanger (ground heat exchanger or other type) or a plant loop with a heating source such as a boiler and a cooling source such as a chiller or cooling tower.~ The diagram below shows the setup and connection of the heat pump for the source side and load side for a ground heat exchanger configuration. Note that on the load side, the WaterToAirHeatPump cooling coil must always be placed before the WaterToAirHeatPump heating coil.
For this zone heat pump,there are two types of WaterToAirHeatPump coil model allowed:
  {Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit}
  {Coil:Heating:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit}
  {Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeat{Pump:VariableSpeed}EquationFit}
  {Coil:Heating:WaterToAirHeat{Pump:VariableSpeed}EquationFit}
```

```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the heat pump operates during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the heat pump must be off for that time period. A value greater than 0 denotes that the heat pump is available to operate during that time period. This schedule may be used to completely disable the heat pump (all of its coils and the supply air fan) as required. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
```

```
This field specifies the type of outdoor air mixer used by this WaterToAirHeatPump unit. The outdoor air mixer component is part of the WaterToAirHeatPump compound object. The only available outdoor air mixer type is:
  {OutdoorAir:Mixer}
This input field should be left blank when the WaterToAirHeatPump is connected to an {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object. If this field is left blank, an outdoor air mixer object is not simulated.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Air Mixer Name 
OutdoorAirMixerName
```
This alpha field defines the name of an outdoor air mixer component which composes part of the zone WaterToAirHeatPump. The return air stream node of the outdoor air mixer should also be the same node as the air inlet node of the WaterToAirHeatPump. Furthermore, the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node should be the same as the WaterToAirHeatPump's fan inlet air node (for blow through fan placement) or the WaterToAirHeatPump's cooling coil inlet node (for draw through fan placement). This input field should be left blank when the WaterToAirHeatPump is connected to an {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object. If this field is left blank, an outdoor air mixer object is not simulated.
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Supply Air Flow Rate 
CoolingSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX cooling coil is operating. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Supply Air Flow Rate 
HeatingSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX heating coil and/or supplemental heater are operating. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable.
```
	
##  Field: No Load Supply Air Flow Rate 
NoLoadSupplyAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when neither cooling or heating is required (i.e., DX coils and supplemental heater are off but the supply air fan operates). This field is only used when the heat pump's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation. Values must be greater than or equal to zero, or this field is autosizable. If the heat pump's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation and this value is set to zero or this field is left blank, then the model assumes that the supply air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is equal to the supply air flow rate when the cooling or heating coil was last operating (for cooling operation or heating operation).
```
	
##  Field: Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate 
CoolingOutdoorAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX cooling coil is operating. Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the outside air flow rate during cooling operation is fixed; it cannot change during the simulation. In addition, the outside air flow rate during cooling operation cannot be greater than the heat pump's supply air flow rate during cooling operation. This input field is set to zero flow when the WaterToAirHeatPump is connected to an {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object.
```
	
##  Field: Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate 
HeatingOutdoorAirFlowRate
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX heating coil and/or supplemental heater are operating. Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the outside air flow rate during heating operation is fixed; it cannot change during the simulation. In addition, the outside air flow rate during heating operation cannot be greater than the heat pump's supply air flow rate during heating operation. This input field is set to zero flow when the WaterToAirHeatPump is connected to an {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object.
```
	
##  Field: No Load Outdoor Air Flow Rate When No Cooling or Heating is Needed 
NoLoadOutdoorAirFlowRateWhenNoCoolingOrHeatingIsNeeded
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the heat pump in cubic meters per second when neither cooling or heating is required (i.e., DX coils and supplemental heater are off but the supply air fan operates). Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the no load outdoor air flow rate cannot change during the simulation. In addition, the no load outdoor air flow rate cannot be greater than the heat pump's no load supply air flow rate. This field is only used when the heat pump's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation. If the heat pump's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation and the field ``No Load Supply Air Flow Rate'' is set to zero or is left blank, then the model assumes that the no load outdoor air flow rate is equal to the outdoor air flow rate when the cooling or heating coil was last operating (for cooling operation [i.e., Cooling outdoor air flow rate] or heating operation [i.e., Heating outdoor air flow rate]) and this field is not used. This input field is set to zero flow when the WaterToAirHeatPump is connected to an {{AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}} object.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Object Type 
SupplyAirFanObjectType

```
	
##  Field: Heat Pump Fan Delay Time 
HeatPumpFanDelayTime
```
This numeric field contains the time delay in seconds for the heat pump supply air fan to shut off after compressor cycle off. This value can be obtained from the manufacturer or the heat pump catalog. Suggested value is 60 seconds. This value is disregared at times when the WaterToAirHeatPump's fan operating mode schedule value is greater than 0 (i.e., continuous fan mode).
```
	
##  Field: Supplemental Heating Coil Object Type 
SupplementalHeatingCoilObjectType
```
This is the object type of the supplemental heating coil. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connector objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the supplemental heating coil does not require additional controller or {Controller:WaterCoil} object. The parent object (Zone Water to Air Heat Pump) itself provides the ``controller'' function of modulating water flow. The valid choices are:
  {Coil:Heating:Electric}
  {Coil:Heating:Fuel}
  {Coil:Heating:Water}
  {Coil:Heating:Steam}
```
	
##  Field: Supplemental Heating Coil Name 
SupplementalHeatingCoilName
```
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the supplemental heating coil, and should match the name specified in the corresponding supplemental heating coil object.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Supply Air Temperature from Supplemental Heater 
MaximumSupplyAirTemperatureFromSupplementalHeater
```
This numeric field defines the maximum allowed supply air temperature exiting the heat pump supplemental heating coil in degrees Celsius. If this input field is left blank, the value defaults to autosize.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Supplemental Heater Operation 
MaximumOutdoorDryBulbTemperatureForSupplementalHeaterOperation
```
This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature in degrees Celsius above which the heat pump supplemental heating coil is disabled. The temperature for this input field must be less than or equal to 21{\degreeCelsius}. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 21{\degreeCelsius}.
```
	
##  Field: Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature Sensor Node Name 
OutdoorDryBulbTemperatureSensorNodeName
```
This alpha field specifies the name of the outdoor node which controls the operation of the supplemental heating coil. If this field is left blank, the outdoor temperature is based solely on the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be listed in an {OutdoorAir:Node} object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name must be specified in an {OutdoorAir:NodeList} object where the outdoor temperature is taken directly from the weather data.
```
	
##  Field: Fan Placement 
FanPlacement
```
This alpha field has two choices: {BlowThrough} or {DrawThrough}. The first choice represents a blow through system where the supply air fan is before the WaterToAirHeatPump cooling/heating coil and the supplementary heating coil. The second choice represents a draw through system where the supply fan is between the WaterToAirHeatPump cooling/heating coil and the supplementary heating coil. If this input field is left blank, the default is blow through.
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name 
SupplyAirFanOperatingModeScheduleName
```
This alpha field specifies the name of the supply air fan operating mode schedule. The supply air fan operating mode may vary during the simulation based on time-of-day or with a change of season. Schedule values of 0 denote that the supply air fan and the heating or cooling coil cycle on and off together to meet the heating or cooling load (a.k.a. AUTO fan). Schedule values other than 0 denote that the supply air fan runs continuously while the heating or cooling coil cycles to meet the load. If this field is left blank, the model assumes the supply air fan cycles with the heating or cooling coil throughout the simulation.
As shown in the example below, correct specifications of the WatertoAirHeatPump requires specification of the following objects in addition to the ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump object:
  On/Off fan
  WatertoAirHeatPump cooling coil (EquationFit only)
  WatertoAirHeatPump heating coil (EquationFit only)
  Supplementary heating coil
  Outdoor air mixer
  Condenser loop or plant loop demand branches
```
	
##  Field: Availability Manager List Name 
AvailabilityManagerListName
```
This optional input field is the name of an {AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList} object. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this WatertoAirHeatPump or object's fan. If the WatertoAirHeatPump is available (per the Availability Schedule Name input field above) and this input field has a valid availability manager assignment list name, then the availability managers in the list determine when and if the fan of this WatertoAirHeatPump object should be on or off.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Pump Coil Water Flow Mode 
HeatPumpCoilWaterFlowMode
```
This field specifies the way in which water flow through the heat pump coils will be modeled.~ This field is only used when WatertoAirHeatPump:EquationFit coils are used. There are three options:
  Cycling
  Constant
  CyclingOnDemand
{Cycling} varies water flow through the coil based on the heat pump Part Load Ratio. This control method is appropriate for modeling heat pumps that are outfitted with a soleniod valve which allows water to flow through the coil only when the compressor is active. This is the default for EnergyPlus V8 and later.
{Constant} provides a constant water flow regardless of heat pump operation. Remember that EnergyPlus has two coils (a heating coil and a cooling coil) to approximate the operation of one coil that can operate in either heating mode or cooling mode. Therefore, when the water flow mode is constant, there will be full flow through either the heating coil or the cooling coil, but not both at the same time.
{ConstantOnDemand} provides full flow through the coil whenever there is a load. When there is no load, there is zero flow through the coil.~ This control strategy represents the way EnergyPlus modeled heat pump water flow prior to Version 8.
```
	
##  Field: Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing Object Name 
DesignSpecificationZoneHVACSizingObjectName
```

# ZoneHVACDehumidifierDX

`ZoneHVAC:Dehumidifier:DX`
```
This object can be used for modeling conventional mechanical dehumidifiers. These systems use a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil to cool and dehumidify an airstream. Heat from the DX system's condenser section is rejected into the cool/dehumidified airstream, resulting in warm dry air being supplied from the unit. In EnergyPlus, this object is modeled as a type of zone equipment (ref. {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList} and {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}).
The model has inputs for water removal, energy factor and air flow rate at rated conditions (26.7{\degreeCelsius}, 60% RH). Curve objects must be specified to describe performance at off-rated conditions. A part-load cycling curve input must also be specified to account for inefficiencies due to cycling. Other inputs including minimum and maximum operating temperatures for dehumidifier operation, off-cycle parasitic load, and an input to direct the removed water to a storage tank.
The model assumes that this equipment dehumidifies and heats the air. If used in tandem with another system that cools and dehumidifies the zone air, then the zone dehumidifier should be specified as the lowest cooling priority in the {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList} object for best control of zone temperature and humidity levels (e.g., if there are 3 pieces of equipment in {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList}, then the zone dehumidifier should have Cooling Priority = 3). With this zone equipment prioritization, the other cooling and dehumidification system would operate first to meet the temperature setpoint (and possibly meet the high humidity setpoint as well). If additional dehumidification is needed, then the zone dehumidifier would operate. The sensible heat generated by the dehumidifier is carried over to the zone air heat balance for the next HVAC time step.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
A unique user-assigned name for an instance of a zone DX dehumidifier unit. Any reference to this dehumidifier by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the dehumidifier operates during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the dehumidifier will not operate for that time period. A value greater than 0 denotes that the dehumidifier is available to operate during that time period. If this field is left blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Air Inlet Node Name 
AirInletNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node from which the dehumidifier draws its inlet air. This node name must be the name of a zone air exhaust node (ref. {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}).
```
	
##  Field: Air Outlet Node Name 
AirOutletNodeName
```
This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node to which the dehumidifier sends its outlet air. This node name must be the name of a zone air inlet node (ref. {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}).
```
	
##  Field: Rated Water Removal 
RatedWaterRemoval
```
This numeric input is the full load water removal rate, in liters per day, at rated conditions (air entering the dehumidifier at 26.7{\degreeCelsius} [80°F] dry-bulb and 60% relative humidity, and air flow rate as defined by field ``Rated Air Flow Rate'' below). This is a required input field and the entered value must be greater than zero.
```
	
##  Field: Rated Energy Factor 
RatedEnergyFactor
```
This numeric input is the energy factor (liters of water removed per kWh of electricity consumed) at rated conditions (air entering the dehumidifier at 26.7{\degreeCelsius} [80°F] dry-bulb and 60% relative humidity, and air flow rate as defined by field ``Rated Air Flow Rate'' below). This is a required input field and the entered value must be greater than zero.
```
	
##  Field: Rated Air Flow Rate 
RatedAirFlowRate
```
This numeric input is the volumetric air flow rate through the dehumidifier, in {\volumeFlowRate}, at rated conditions (air entering the dehumidifier at 26.7{\degreeCelsius} [80°F] dry-bulb and 60% relative humidity). This is a required input field and the entered value must be greater than zero.
```
	
##  Field: Water Removal Curve Name 
WaterRemovalCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of water removal as a function of the dry-bulb temperature ({\degreeCelsius}) and relative humidity (%) of the air entering the dehumidifier. The output of this curve is multiplied by the Rated Water Removal to give the water removal of the dehumidifier at specific operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures and relative humidity levels different from the rating point conditions). The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point (air entering the dehumidifier at 26.7{\degreeCelsius} [80°F] dry-bulb and 60% relative humidity, and air flow rate as defined by field ``Rated Air Flow Rate'' above).
```
	
##  Field: Energy Factor Curve Name 
EnergyFactorCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy factor as a function of the dry-bulb temperature ({\degreeCelsius}) and relative humidity (%) of the air entering the dehumidifier. The output of this curve is multiplied by the Rated Energy Factor to give the energy factor of the dehumidifier at specific operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures and relative humidity levels different from the rating point conditions). The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point (air entering the dehumidifier at 26.7{\degreeCelsius} [80°F] dry-bulb and 60% relative humidity, and air flow rate as defined by field ``Rated Air Flow Rate'' above).
```
	
##  Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name 
PartLoadFractionCorrelationCurveName
```
This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the dehumidifier as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, defined as the water removal load to be met (kg/s) divided by the dehumidifier's water removal rate (kg/s) at the current operating conditions). The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.
The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the dehumidifier runs continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 < = PLR < 1), the following rules apply:
0.7 < = PLF < = 1.0~~ and~~ PLF > = PLR
If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the dehumidifier is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the dehumidifier is set to 1.0.
Mechanical dehumidifier typically have long runtimes with minimal compressor cycling. So, a typical part load fraction correlation might be:
~~~~~ PLF = 0.95 + 0.05(PLR)
If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:
~~~~~ PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)
```
	
##  Field: Minimum Dry-Bulb Temperature for Dehumidifier Operation

This input value must be less than the Maximum Dry-Bulb Temperature for Dehumidifier Operation, and the default value is 10{\degreeCelsius}.
```
	
##  Field: Maximum Dry-Bulb Temperature for Dehumidifier Operation 
MaximumDryBulbTemperatureForDehumidifierOperation
```
This numeric field defines the maximum inlet air dry-bulb temperature for dehumidifier operation. The dehumidifier will not operate if the inlet air temperature is above this value. This input value must be greater than the Minimum Dry-Bulb Temperature for Dehumidifier Operation, and the default value is 35{\degreeCelsius}.
```
	
##  Field: Off-Cycle Parasitic Electric Load 
OffCycleParasiticElectricLoad
```
This numeric field contains the off-cycle parasitic electric power in Watts. This is the parasitic electric power consumed by controls or other electrical devices associated with the dehumidifier. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the dehumidifier is available to operate, but is not operating. The model assumed that this parasitic power contributes to heating the zone air (i.e., affects the zone air heat balance). The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if this field is left blank.
```
	
##  Field: Condensate Collection Water Storage Tank Name 
CondensateCollectionWaterStorageTankName
```
This field is optional. It is used to specify where condensate from the dehumidifier is collected. If blank or omitted, then any water (condensate) removed is discarded. Enter the name of a Water Storage Tank (ref. {WaterUse:Storage}) object defined elsewhere and the condensate will then be collected in that tank.
Following is an example input for a zone DX dehumidifier object. A {ZoneControl:Humidistat} object must also be specified for the zone to which the dehumidifier is connected (connect via a zone air exhaust node and a zone air inlet node, ref. {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}).

# ZoneHVACEnergyRecoveryVentilator

`ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator`
```
The ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator - stand alone energy recovery ventilator (ERV) is a single-zone HVAC component used for exhaust air heat recovery (Figure{fig:zonehvac-energyrecoveryventilator-compound}). This compound object consists of 3 required components: a generic air-to-air heat exchanger (see object Heat Exchanger:Air to Air:Generic), a supply air fan, and an exhaust air fan (see object {Fan:OnOff}).
An optional controller (see object {ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator:Controller}) may be used to simulate economizer (free cooling) operation, modify air flow rates based on high indoor humidity, or simulate a ``push-button'' type economizer controller.
This compound object models the basic operation of supply and exhaust air fans and an air-to-air heat exchanger. The stand alone ERV operates whenever the unit is scheduled to be available (Availability schedule). The stand alone ERV object can be used in conjunction with an economizer feature whereby heat exchange is suspended whenever free cooling is available (i.e., air flow is fully bypassed around a fixed-plate heat exchanger or the rotation of a rotary heat exchanger is stopped). The economizer feature may also be activated based on a time-of-day schedule. Heat exchange is also suspended when air flow rates through the heat exchanger are modified in response to a zone humidistat. When an economizer is used in conjunction with high humidity control, high humidity control has the priority.
To model a stand alone ERV connected to a single zone, the input data file should include the following objects:
  ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator
  {HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent}
  {Fan:OnOff} (supply air)
  {Fan:OnOff} (exhaust air)
  {ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator:Controller} (if economizer [free cooling] mode or high humidity control operation is desired)
  {ZoneControl:Humidistat} (required for high humidity control option)
  {SetpointManager:Scheduled} (if supply air outlet temperature control is used, Ref. Heat Exchanger:Air to Air:Generic for additional guidance)
  {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}
  {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList}
  {OutdoorAir:NodeList}
A description of each input field for this compound object is provided below.
```

##  Field: Name 
Name
```
A unique user-assigned name for the stand alone ERV unit. Any reference to this unit by another object will use this name.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Schedule Name 
AvailabilityScheduleName
```
The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the unit can operate during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can operate during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit will not operate. If this field is left blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.
```
	
##  Field: Heat Exchanger Name 
HeatExchangerName
```
The user-assigned name corresponding to the air-to-air heat exchanger used in this compound object. The only allowable type is:.
{HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent}
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Flow Rate 
SupplyAirFlowRate
```
The supply air flow rate through the ERV unit in cubic meters per second at standard temperature and pressure (dry air at 20{\degreeCelsius} drybulb). The program uses local barometric pressure to account for altitude using the equation for ``standard atmospheric'' pressure on p 6.1 of the ASHRAE 1997 HOF (SI edition) to initialize the air systems being simulated.
p = 101325*(1-2.25577E-05*Z)**5.2559
where p = pressure in Pa and Z = altitude in m
Note that this flow rate must be within the valid air flow range for the heat exchanger (ref: {HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent} in the Engineering Document). In addition, this flow rate must be less than or equal to the supply fan air flow rate ({Fan:OnOff}). If the supply air flow rate is less than the exhaust air flow rate, the zone infiltration (ref: ZoneInfiltration) should be specified accordingly (the infiltration induced by imbalanced air flows is not accounted for automatically). The ERV supply air flow rate may also be autosized using the ventilation rate per floor area and/or ventilation rate per occupant fields below. When autosizing, the heat exchanger and fan air flow rates should also be autosized.
Note: The supply air inlet node specified in the generic heat exchanger object must be an outdoor air node (ref: {OutdoorAir:Node} and {OutdoorAir:NodeList}). The supply air outlet node specified in the generic heat exchanger object must be a zone air inlet node (ref: {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}).
```
	
##  Field: Exhaust Air Flow Rate 
ExhaustAirFlowRate
```
The exhaust air flow rate through the ERV unit in cubic meters per second at standard temperature and pressure (dry air at 20{\degreeCelsius} drybulb). The program uses local barometric pressure to account for altitude using the equation for ``standard atmospheric'' pressure on p 6.1 of the ASHRAE 1997 HOF (SI edition) to initialize the air systems being simulated.
p = 101325*(1-2.25577E-05*Z)**5.2559
where p = pressure in Pa and Z = altitude in m
Note that this flow rate must be within the valid air flow range for the heat exchanger (ref: {HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent} in the Engineering Document). In addition, this flow rate must be less than or equal to the exhaust fan air flow rate ({Fan:OnOff}). If the exhaust air flow rate is greater than the supply air flow rate, the zone infiltration (ref: ZoneInfiltration) should be specified accordingly (the infiltration induced by imbalanced air flows is not accounted for automatically). The ERV exhaust air flow rate may also be autosized using the ventilation rate per floor area and/or ventilation rate per occupant fields below. When autosizing, the heat exchanger and fan air flow rates should also be autosized.
Note: The exhaust air inlet node specified in the generic heat exchanger object must be a zone air exhaust node (ref: {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}).
```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Name

```
	
##  Field: Ventilation Rate per Unit Floor Area 
VentilationRatePerUnitFloorArea
```
This optional numeric field defines the ventilation rate per unit floor area in cubic meters per second per square meter. This field is only used when the supply and exhaust air flow rates are autosized.
```
	
##  Field: Ventilation Rate per Occupant 
VentilationRatePerOccupant
```
This optional numeric field defines the ventilation rate per occupant in cubic meters per second per occupant. This field is only used when the supply and exhaust air flow rates are autosized.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Manager List Name 
AvailabilityManagerListName
```
This optional input field is the name of an {AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList} object. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this Stand Alone ERV~ object's fan. If the Stand Alone ERV is available (per the Availability Schedule Name input field above) and this input field has a valid availability manager assignment list name, then the availability managers in the list determine when and if the fan of this Stand Alone ERV~ object should be on or off.
Following is an example input for this compound object and associated objects that may be defined:

# ZoneHVACTerminalUnitVariableRefrigerantFlow

`ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow`
```
Terminal units with variable refrigerant flow compound HVAC object are used exclusively with variable refrigerant flow (VRF) air conditioning systems (Ref. {AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow} objects). The VRF terminal unit may be used as zone, air loop or outside air system equipment. The VRF terminal unit compound object contains an optional outdoor air mixer, a DX cooling coil, a DX heating coil, a supply fan (optional for air loop and outdoor air system equipment), and an optional supplemental heating coil object.
Note: The terminal unit may be used in the air loop and/or outdoor air system, however, at this time only constant flow (or limited variation within the limits allowed for DX coils) through the unit is allowed. Using a wide range of outdoor air flow rates will cause the DX coil model to fail. For example, if the minimum outdoor air flow rate is allowed to fall near 0, the DX coil model will calculate very low, even very negative, coil outlet temperatures. This can cause psychrometric warnings to occur and cause the simulation to end prematurely.
For zone equipment the terminal units are connected to a zone using the inlet and exhaust node names specified in a {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections} object. The zone exhaust node has the same name as the terminal unit air inlet node. The zone inlet node has the same name as the terminal unit air outlet node. The zone terminal unit is also listed in a zone's equipment list and will typically be the first equipment operating for both cooling and heating (i.e., Sequence = 1 in the {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList}). Other ZoneHVAC equipment may be used in the same zone and should be sequenced to operate after the zone terminal units (i.e., sequence = 2 or higher).
For air loop equipment and outdoor air system equipment the VRF terminal unit inlet and outlet nodes define the location of the system in the air loop and outdoor air system. The node names must define the path of the air stream in order from the beginning of the air loop or outdoor air system to the outlet of that system.
This VRF terminal unit can be controlled based on a load or set point. When the system is used as zone equipment, load control is always used. When the VRF terminal unit is used in an air loop and the control zone name or thermostat location is specified, the system is controlled based on zone load. If the control zone name or thermostat location is not specified the VRF terminal unit will be controlled based on termninal unit or coil outlet node set point temperature. When set point based control is used the node temperature set points may be placed at the outlet of the terminal unit or at individual coil outlet nodes. If the VRF terminal unit is used in an air loop's outdoor air system, control is always based on a termninal unit or coil outlet node temperature set point.
The terminal units operate to satisfy a heating or cooling load in a zone based on a zone thermostat temperature set point. A direct-expansion (DX) cooling and/or DX heating coil is specified depending on the operating mode required. Both a DX cooling and DX heating coil will typically be installed in the terminal unit, however only one may be used if desired. An optional supplemental heating coil can also be added to the terminal unit to provide additional heating when the main DX heating coil could not meet the entire heating load of a zone during cold outdoor conditions. The Supplemental Heating Coil Object Type must be {Coil:Heating:Electric}, {Coil:Heating:Fuel}, {Coil:Heating:Water}, or {Coil:Heating:Steam}. Outdoor ventilation air is modeled with the use of an optional outside air mixer object. Outside air may be provided to the zone only when the coil is operating or can be supplied continuously even when the coil is not operating.
A supply air fan can be modeled as either draw through or blow through. The supply air fan is required for zone equipment and optional for air loop and outdoor air system equipment. The Supply Air Fan Object Type must be {Fan:SystemModel}, {Fan:OnOff}, or {Fan:ConstantVolume} if {AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow} is used to model the VRF outdoor unit. The Supply Air Fan Object Type must be {Fan:SystemModel} or {Fan:VariableVolume} if AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:\-FluidTemperatureControl or AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:\-FluidTemperatureControl:HR is used to model the VRF outdoor unit.

```
	
##  Field: Supply Air Fan Placement 
SupplyAirFanPlacement
```
This alpha field has two choices: {BlowThrough} or {DrawThrough}. If this field is left blank, the default is blow through.
The first choice stands for ``blow through fan''. This means that the unit consists of a fan followed by the DX coils. The fan ``blows through'' the cooling and heating coils. If an outside air mixer is used, the fan inlet connects to the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node. If an outdoor air mixer is not used, the fan inlet connects to the zone exhaust node. For this configuration, the fan outlet always connects to the DX cooling coil inlet node (or if a DX cooling coil is not used, the DX heating coil inlet node).
The second choice stands for ``draw through fan''. This means that the unit consists of the DX coil(s) followed by a fan. The fan ``draws air through'' the DX coil(s). In this case the fan inlet always connects to the DX heating coil outlet node (or if a DX heating coil is not use, the DX cooling coil outlet node) and the fan outlet node always connects to the zone inlet node.
```

```
	
##  Field: Rated Total Heating Capacity Sizing Ratio 
RatedTotalHeatingCapacitySizingRatio
```
This numeric field defines the ratio of the heating coil to cooling coil size when autosizing is used. The model assumes that when used, this value will be greater than 1. This field supersedes the Rated Total Heating Capacity Sizing Ratio entered in the {AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow} object. If this field is left blank, the value entered in the parent object is used for sizing. If neither field is used, the sizing ratio is assumed to be 1.
```
	
##  Field: Availability Manager List Name 
AvailabilityManagerListName
```
This optional input field is the name of an {AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList} object. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this Zone Terminal Unit object's fan.

# ZoneHVACHybridUnitaryHVAC

`ZoneHVAC:HybridUnitaryHVAC`
```
ZoneHVAC:Hybrid UnitaryHVAC is a black-box model for packaged forced air equipment with multiple discrete operating modes. Generally, a ''hybrid`` is any system that exhibits both continuous and discrete dynamic behavior ??? a system that can both flow (as could be described by a differential equation) and jump (as must be described by distinct modes). Equipment in this category may utilize a wide variety technologies including, but not limited to: indirect evaporative cooling, desiccant dehumidification, heat recovery, vapor compression, adsorption, or ventilation cooling. Each hybrid system packages multiple technologies into a single integrated system. There are a multitude of unique hybrid system architectures, and each unique system may have numerous unique operating modes.
ZoneHVAC:HybridUnitaryHVAC is a black-box model designed to allow empirical representation of a wide variety of hybrid unitary systems. The model does not require information about internal system architecture, however it requires extensive data to describe the performance of a product in every operating mode. The model is intended for packed forced air equipment and can represent unitary systems that consume electricity, water, and up to two additional fuel types.
Uncontrolled independent variables include outdoor and indoor air temperature and humidity ratio. Controlled independent variables include: operating mode, supply air flow rate, outdoor air fraction, and part runtime fraction. Dependent variables include supply air temperature, supply air humidity, electricity use, fuel uses, water use, fan electricity use, and external static pressure. Empirical data tables (see {Table:Lookup}) are required to map each dependent variable in each discrete operating mode. The model can accommodate up to 26 discrete operating modes, including a standby mode. Each mode is limited to operate within independently specified ranges of indoor and outdoor psychrometric conditions.  The standby mode is not limited by either indoor or outdoor psychrometric conditions.
ZoneHVAC:HybridUnitaryHVAC is structured as a constrained optimization problem ??? in each time step the model will choose one or more combinations of the controlled independent variables so as to best provide the predicted sensible load, the predicted latent load, and the scheduled zone ventilation requirement, with the least amount of resource consumption.
A setting is defined as any unique combination of mode, outdoor air fraction, and supply air flow rate. The system may operate with multiple settings in each time step. The portion of each time step spent in a setting is described as the part runtime fraction for that setting. During any time step that the combination of settings can satisfy all of the soft constraints with part runtime fractions that sum to less than one, the system will operate in a standby mode (Mode 0) for the remainder of the timestep. If no combination of settings will satisfy all of  the soft constraints the system will choose the combination of settings that most nearly satisfies all soft constraints. If the indoor and outdoor psychrometric conditions are beyond the constraints that limit each operating mode, or if no setting will satisfy all constraints on supply air temperature and absolute humidity, the system will operate in standby mode (Mode 0).
