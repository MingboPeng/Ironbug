Sometimes, however, it is desirable to supply central system air directly to a zone without any zone level control or tempering. An example would be a single zone reheat system.

The control zone receives supply air directly from the central system since the supply air temperature has been adjusted to control the temperature in the control zone. The slave zones then have baseboards or reheat coils to allow some temperature adjustment. The AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Uncontrolled object creates the capability of supplying central system air directly to a zone. Its input consists of the object name, an availability (on/off) schedule, and a node name. This node is both a zone inlet node and an outlet node of the AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter.

For the objects to work correctly, it is important in any systems including Direct Air objects for the sum of the maximum zone air flow rates to be equal to the maximum central system flow rate. The zone maximum flow rates are specified in the zone terminal unit or direct air inputs. The central air system flow rate is specified in the AirLoopHVAC input and also in the air loop branch and central fan inputs.

These options are used if the minimum air flow rate is not adequate to serve the peak heating load. This is sometimes called the dual maximum control logic as illustrated in following figure.

The fan is used to control the flow of conditioned air that enters the space. When the fan is off the plenum pressure drives the minimum air flow through the terminal unit. At maximum cooling the fan runs at its maximum speed. At full heating the fan runs at its heating maximum -- usually less than the cooling maximum flow rate. Thus this unit has two separate maximum flow rates -- one for heating and one for cooling.

For cooling, control is maintained simply by varying the fan speed. For heating, the unit first tries to meet the heating load by varying the heating coil output while keeping the air flow at minimum (fan off). If this is not adequate the fan turns on and operates in variable flow mode up to the heating maximum flow rate.

This unit is modeled in EnergyPlus as a compound component -- a variable speed fan and a heating coil in series in the air stream. The unit is blow through -- the fan is upstream of the heating coil.

The unit contains a small fan that acts to induce the secondary air and a heating coil for heating the mixed secondary and primary air. The secondary and primary air streams enter the unit in parallel. The fan sits in the secondary air stream and runs only when the primary air flow is below the Fan On Flow Fraction and the fan's availability schedule is on or it is activated by an availability manager. The primary air inlet contains a damper that can move from fully open (maximum primary air) to a minimum stop (minimum primary air).

At full cooling load the primary air damper is fully open and the fan is off. The primary air flow is at maximum and there is little or no secondary air flow. As the cooling load decreases, the primary air damper gradually closes and the secondary air flow remains close to zero. At some point, usually when the primary air flow has reached the minimum, the fan switches on and secondary air is induced. The heating coil will switch on as needed to meet any heating demand. The Fan On Flow Fraction field controls the fan operation; see this field description for more details. 

The EnergyPlus model of the parallel PIU terminal unit is composed of three components: a constant volume fan, a zone mixer, and a heating coil (hot water, electric, or gas).

The central air is discharged through a nozzle in the terminal unit, inducing a flow of room air over a hydronic heating/cooling coil.

	public static class AirTerminalSingleDuctConstantVolumeFourPipeBeam
    { 
		public static string Name = @"AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:FourPipeBeam";
		public static string Note = @"The four-pipe beam air terminal system is a mixed air-hydronic system. A central, single-duct forced-air system that supplies conditioned air to the zones. Chilled water circulates through ceiling-mounted fin-tube convector units to provide sensible cooling. Hot water circulates through the same convectors to provide heating. Water flow rate through the beam unit is varied to meet the zone sensible cooling or heating load. Any dehumidification is done by the central forced-air system. Thermodynamically, the cooled beam system resembles the four-pipe induction unit ({AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:FourPipeInduction}).

To model a typical four-pipe beam system the user will need to define a conventional central constant volume forced air system in order to deliver primary air to the beam. This central system (usually) provides outside air for ventilation. Primary air is normally delivered at a fixed temperature but could be reset by a schedule or using an outdoor air reset setpoint manager. On the supply side of this air loop there will be the usual central conditioning equipment: outside air mixer, fan, heating and cooling coil. On the zone equipment (demand) side of the loop, the four-pipe beams will be represented as air terminal units. Because the four-pipe beam can provide heating the system can avoid over-cooling zones during times of low load with cool primary air temperatures, similar to the action of a reheat coil in a VAV terminal. Therefore it is not necessary to have additional zone equipment (such as baseboard heaters) to handle heating (or reheating) loads.

Although the four-pipe beam equipment in a zone is treated by the program as a single terminal unit, the actual installation will often have multiple beam units in each zone. In this model, it is only the total length of all the beams and the total air flow of all the units that are described, not the number of individual beam units.

If needed, the program (in its sizing calculation for the system) determines the total length of beams and primary supply air flow that is needed to meet the zone design loads. The four pipe beam air terminal sizing differs from other air terminals in that the primary supply air flow rate is sized using the entire performance model and the flow rate is not the direct result from the Sizing:Zone and Sizing:System calculations. The flow rates will be somewhere between what an air terminal would size out using {VentilationRequirement} or {Sensible} in the Sizing:System object (either setting can be used).

The model includes two different types of inputs for flow rates, ``design'' and ``rated \ldots{} per-meter.'' The design values are the actual sizes of the flow rates as viewed from the zone and central air handler (but before zone multipliers). The design values include all the individual beam units and their lengths. The rated per-meter values are used to characterize product performance at nominal rating conditions in such a way that it can be scaled to match the size of a zone. The performance characteristics at the rating point are not fixed in the program and can be entered by the user when they differ from default values. The rated per meter values are normalized by the linear dimensions of the beam and are generally obtained from product catalog data by dividing by the length of the beam. The rated primary air flow rate is assumed to be for sea level conditions while the design primary air flow rate is modeled for the location elevation above sea level.

Sensible cooling is done by chilled water circulating through ceiling mounted cooled beam units. Chilled water flow rate through the cooled beam units is varied to meet the zone sensible cooling load. Any dehumidification is done by the central ventilation air system. Heating is usually accomplished with hot water radiators. Thermodynamically, the cooled beam system resembles the four-pipe induction unit.

To model a typical cooled beam system the user will need to define a conventional central constant volume forced air system. This system will normally be 100% outside air delivered at a fixed supply temperature (which could be reset by schedule or by outside air temperature). On the supply side of this air loop there will be the usual central AC equipment: outside air mixer, fan, heating and cooling coil. On the zone equipment (demand) side of the loop, the chilled beams will be represented as terminal units. Additional zone equipment (such as baseboard heaters) will be needed to handle heating loads.

Although the cooled beam equipment in a zone is treated by the program as a single terminal unit, the actual installation will have multiple beams in each zone. The program (in its sizing calculation for the system) figures out how many beams of what length are needed to meet the zone design load.

The cooling tower is modeled as a counterflow heat exchanger with a single-speed fan (induced draft configuration) based on Merkel's theory. The user must define tower performance via one of two methods: design heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or nominal tower capacity at a specific rating point. Regardless of which method is chosen, the design airflow rate and corresponding fan power must be specified. The model will also account for tower performance in the ``free convection'' regime, when the tower fan is off but the water pump remains on and heat transfer still occurs (albeit at a low level). If the user wants the model to account for ``free convection'', they must specify the corresponding airflow rate and heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA), or the nominal tower capacity during this mode of operation.

The cooling tower seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to determine the impact of ``free convection'', if specified by the user, on the tower exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on ``free convection'' is at or below the set point, then the tower fan is not turned on. If the exiting water temperature based on ``free convection'' is below the set point, the tower will operate in FluidBypass mode -- portion of the water goes through the tower media and gets cooled while the remaining water flow gets bypassed, two water flows then mix together trying to meet the water setpoint temperature. If the exiting water temperature remains above the set point after ``free convection'' is modeled, then the tower fan is turned on to reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point. If the capacity control is FanCycling, the model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., tower fan on for the entire simulation timestep and tower fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account. If the capacity control is FluidBypass, the model determines the fraction of water flow to be bypassed while the remaining water goes through the tower cooling media and gets cooled, then the two water flows mix to meet the setpoint temperature. In this case, the fan runs at full speed for the entire timestep.

Cooling towers here are ``wet'' and consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the towers. The last six input fields are optional and provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specify connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a water storage tanks (i.e.~WaterUse:Storage objects).

For the operation of multi-cell towers, the first step is to determine the number of cells to operate based on the cell control method -- between the minimum number of cells subject to the maximum water flow rate fraction per cell, and maximum number of cells subject to the minimum water flow rate fraction per cell. If the calculated cells do not meet the loads, additional cells will be operating to help meet the loads. Inside each cell, the existing capacity controls still apply.

For multi-cell towers, the following inputs are assumed to be for the entire tower including all cells:

    { 
		public static string Name = @"CoolingTower:TwoSpeed";
		public static string Note = @"The two-speed cooling tower is modeled in a similar fashion to the single-speed tower. The cooling tower is modeled as a counterflow heat exchanger with a two-speed fan (induced draft configuration) based on Merkel's theory. The user must define tower performance via one of two methods: heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or nominal tower capacity at a specific rating point. Regardless of which method is chosen, the airflow rate and corresponding fan power at both high and low fan speed must be specified. The model will also account for tower performance in the ``free convection'' regime, when the tower fan is off but the water pump remains on and heat transfer still occurs (albeit at a low level). If the user wants the model to account for ``free convection'', they must specify the corresponding air flow rate and heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA), or the nominal tower capacity during this mode of operation.

The cooling tower seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to determine the impact of ``free convection'', if specified by the user, on the tower exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on ``free convection'' is at or below the set point, then the tower fan is not turned on. If the exiting water temperature remains above the set point after ``free convection'' is modeled, then the tower fan is turned on at low speed to reduce the exiting water temperature. If operating the tower fan at low speed does not reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point, then the tower fan is increased to its high speed.

The model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., tower fan at high speed for the entire simulation timestep and tower fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep, or tower fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep and tower fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account.

Cooling towers here are ``wet'' and consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the towers. The last six input fields are optional and provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specifiy connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a WaterUse:Storage object.

For the operation of multi-cell towers, the first step is to determine the number of cells to operate based on the cell control method -- between the minimum number of cells subject to the maximum water flow rate fraction per cell, and maximum number of cells subject to the minimum water flow rate fraction per cell. If the calculated cells do not meet the loads, additional cells will be operating to help meet the loads. Inside each cell, the existing capacity controls still apply.

For multi-cell towers, the following inputs are assumed to be for the entire tower including all cells:



  Design Water Flow Rate; Design Air Flow Rate; Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;

  Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime; Nominal Capacity; Free Convection Capacity

  BASIN HEATER (we assume that there is a common basin)

		public static string Name = @"CoolingTower:VariableSpeed";
		public static string Note = @"The variable speed tower model is based on empirical curve fits of manufacturer's performance data or field measurements. The user specifies tower performance at design conditions, and empirical curves are used to determine the approach temperature and fan power at off-design conditions. The user defines tower performance by entering the inlet air wet-bulb temperature, tower range, and tower approach temperature at the design conditions. The corresponding water flow rate (within ??25% of the tower's rated water mass flow rate), air flow rate, and fan power must also be specified. The model will account for tower performance in the ``free convection'' regime, when the tower fan is off but the water pump remains on and heat transfer still occurs (albeit at a low level). Basin heater operation and makeup water usage (due to evaporation, drift, and blowdown) are also modeled.

The cooling tower seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to determine the impact of ``free convection'' on the tower exiting water temperature. If the exiting water temperature based on ``free convection'' is at or below the set point, then the variable-speed tower fan is not turned on. If the exiting water temperature is above the set point after ``free convection'' is modeled, then the variable-speed tower fan is turned on to reduce the exiting water temperature. Tower fan power is calculated based on the tower air flow rate required to achieve the exiting water set point temperature.

Cooling towers here are ``wet'' and consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the towers. The last six input fields are optional and provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specifiy connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a WaterUse:Storage object.

For the operation of multi-cell towers, the first step is to determine the number of cells to operate based on the cell control method -- between the minimum number of cells subject to the maximum water flow rate fraction per cell, and maximum number of cells subject to the minimum water flow rate fraction per cell. If the calculated cells do not meet the loads, additional cells will be operating to help meet the loads. Inside each cell, the existing capacity controls still apply.

For multi-cell towers, the following inputs are assumed to be for the entire tower including all cells:



  Design Water Flow Rate; Design Air Flow Rate; Fan Power at Design Air Flow Rate;

  Air Flow Rate in Free Convection Regime; Nominal Capacity; Free Convection Capacity

		public static string Note = @"Variable speed cooling towers can be modeled by EnergyPlus with user-selectable performance based on the CoolTools correlation, YorkCalc correlation, or user-defined coefficients for either the CoolTools or YorkCalc correlations.The empirical CoolTools tower correlation uses a set of 35 coefficients to model the thermal performance (approach temperature) of a cooling tower based on four independent variables. If the user specifies Model Type = CoolToolsCrossFlow in the CoolingTower:VariableSpeed object, then the 35 coefficients derived for the CoolTools simulation model are used and these coefficients are already defined within EnergyPlus. If the user specifies Model Type = CoolToolsUserDefined, then the user must enter a CoolingTowerPerformance:CoolTools object to define the 35 coefficients that will be used by the CoolTools correlation.

The user must specify a name for the model coefficient object, and this name must be used in the CoolingTower:VariableSpeed object (field Model Coefficient Name) to tell the program to use these coefficients. Next, the user enters the minimum and maximum values for inlet air wet-bulb temperature, range temperature, approach temperature, and water mass flow rate ratio to specify the valid range for which the model coefficients were derived. For all of these variables, the program issues warnings if the actual values are beyond the minimum/maximum values specified. For inlet air wet-bulb temperature and water mass flow rate ratio, the values of these variables used in the calculation of approach temperature are limited to be within the valid minimum/maximum range specified. For approach and range, the warnings are issued if the values are beyond the specified minimum/maximum range but the actual values are still used.

The CoolTools correlation has four independent variables: inlet air wet-bulb temperature (Twb), tower range temperature (Tr), water flow rate ratio (FRwater), and air flow rate ratio (FRair). Temperatures are in units of ??C and flow rate ratios are dimensionless (actual flow rate divided by design flow rate). Using these independent variables, tower approach temperature (??C) is calculated as follows:

Approach = ~~ Coeff(1)~ +~ Coeff(2)???FRair~ +~ Coeff(3)???(FRair)^{2}~ +

Coeff(4)???(FRair)^{3}~ +~ Coeff(5)???FRwater~ +

The Evaporative fluid cooler is modeled as a counter flow heat exchanger with single-speed fans (induced draft configuration). The user must define fluid cooler performance via one of three methods: design heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or standard fluid cooler design capacity at a specific rating point or design capacity at non standard conditions. Regardless of which method is chosen, the design airflow rate and corresponding fan power must be specified.

The evaporative fluid cooler seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the evaporative fluid cooler at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to see whether inlet water temperature is at or below the set point. If so, then the fluid cooler fan is not turned on and all the flow goes through bypass. If the inlet water temperature is above the set point then the fluid cooler fan is turned on to reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point. If the capacity control is FanCycling, the model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., fluid cooler fan on for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account. If the capacity control is FluidBypass, the model determines the fraction of water flow to be bypassed while the remaining water goes through the fluid cooler cooling media and gets cooled, then the two water flows mix to meet the setpoint temperature. In this case, the fan runs at full speed for the entire timestep.

Evaporative fluid coolers consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the fluid coolers. For this purpose, the last seven input fields can either be provided in the input or if nothing is specified then the default values for these fields will be used. These fields provide the methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specify connections to the rest of the building's water system by providing the name of a water storage tanks (i.e.~WaterUse:Storage objects).

		public static string Name = @"EvaporativeFluidCooler:TwoSpeed";
		public static string Note = @"The two-speed evaporative fluid cooler is modeled in a similar fashion to the single-speed evaporative fluid cooler. The evaporative fluid cooler is modeled as a counter flow heat exchanger with two-speed fan (induced draft configuration. See schematic diagram in EvaporativeFluidCooler:SingleSpeed section). The user must define fluid cooler performance via one of the three methods: design heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) and design water flow rate, or standard fluid cooler design capacity at a specific rating point or design capacity at non standard conditions. Regardless of which method is chosen, the design airflow rate and corresponding fan power must be specified.

The evaporative fluid cooler seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the evaporative fluid cooler at (or below) a set point. The set point schedule value is defined by the field ``Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name or Reference'' for the CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to see whether inlet water temperature is at or below the set point. If so, then the fluid cooler fan is not turned on and all the flow goes through bypass. If the inlet water temperature is above the set point then the fluid cooler fan is turned on at low speed to reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point. If operating the fluid cooler fan at low speed does not reduce the exiting water temperature to the set point, then the fluid cooler fan is increased to its high speed.

The model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (i.e., fluid cooler fan at high speed for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep, or fluid cooler fan at low speed for the entire simulation timestep and fluid cooler fan off for the entire simulation timestep). Cyclic losses are not taken into account.

Evaporative fluid coolers consume water through evaporation, drift, and blowdown. The model can be used to predict water consumed by the evaporative fluid coolers. For this purpose, the last seven input fields can either be provided in the input or if nothing is specified then the default values for these fields will be used. These fields provide methods of controlling details of the water consumption calculations. The user can specify connections to the rest of the buildings water system by providing the name of a water storage tanks (i.e.~WaterUse:Storage objects).

Figure \ref{fig:schematic-of-energyplus-ground-loop-heat} shows the Ground Heat Exchanger in the simulation environment.

The heat exchanger response is defined by a g-function which is a non-dimensional function that is used to calculate the response to square heat pulses of different duration. (This function is not the same as `G-factors' referred to in the ASHRAE Applications Handbook). This continuous function is specified by a series of data pairs (LNTTS{i}, GFNC{i}) where,



  LNTTS{i} is the non-dimensional time: {ln(T/T_{s})}

  GFNC{i} is the g-function value


The g-function is different for each borehole field configuration (i.e.~a 4 $\times$ 4 field has a different response than a 80 $\times$ 80 field). It is also dependent on the ratio of borehole spacing to depth. g-function values, for accurate simulation, have to be computed for each specific heat exchanger design. The GroundHeatExchanger:System object will accept three different types of input in order to define the g-functions necessary for the ground heat exchanger calculations.


     Use the GroundHeatExchanger:Vertical:Array object to define a rectangular borehole field. EnergyPlus will compute and cache the g-functions for reuse again in future simulations.
     Use one or more GroundHeatExchanger:Vertical:Single objects to define a vertical borehole field with the boreholes located arbitrarily. EnergyPlus will compute and cache the g-functions for reuse again in future simulations.
     Use a third-party tool, such as GLHEPro, to compute the g-functions and pass them to EnergyPlus using the GroundHeatExchanger:ResponseFactors object.


A small number of reference datasets containing example input data for 1 $\times$ 2, 4 $\times$ 4 and 8 $\times$ 8 configurations and for both standard and thermally enhanced grout are provided as well.

This heat exchanger is fairly general and can be configured for use in any application where any two loops need to be connected together.
The only constraints are that that one side must be connected to the supply side of one loop and the other side connected to the demand side of a different loop.

Because the heat exchanger is intended to be generic, its two sides are distinguished by the nature of loop side being connected.
One side is called {Loop Supply Side} to indicate the heat exchanger is situated on the supply side of a loop.
The other side is called {Loop Demand Side} to indicate it is on the demand side of a loop.
The heat exchanger is intended to act as a supply component for the loop connected to it as the ``Loop Supply Side''
and as a demand component for the loop connected to it as the ``Loop Demand Side.''
From the point of view of the heat exchanger model itself, the Loop Demand Side fluid serves as the source/sink to supply heating/cooling to the fluid in the Loop Supply Side.

This heat exchanger can be used for a wide variety of applications including chilled water, hot water, condenser, ground source, primary-secondary systems, etc.
Heat transfer is calculated and reported using a sign convention from chilled water applications
where {positive heat transfer indicates energy was extracted from the Loop Supply Side and added to the Loop Demand Side.}

{Note}: Only hydronic ``plant'' fluids are allowed (excepting Fluid Type Steam), no air-side connections are possible with this heat exchanger.

{Various options are available for the heat exchanger model.}


    The heat transfer between the two sides can be modeled using one of seven different models for different types of heat exchangers.

    There are also eleven options for different ways to control the heat exchanger.
    
        
            One general type of control is {OnOff} where the flow through the heat exchanger is either fully on or fully off.
        
            Another type of control is {Modulated} where the flow through the Loop Demand Side is controlled to try and meet a target setpoint or load on the Loop Supply Side.

		public static string Field_ControlType = @"This field is used to specify how the heat exchanger is to be controlled during operation.~ Different applications for connecting two loops will require different control behavior and different control options are needed depending on the desired behavior.~ There are the following eleven key choice options to choose from:



  {UncontrolledOn}. This control mode is applicable to situations where the heat exchanger is passively running all the time and always transfers as much heat as possible between the fluid streams.~ However there is one aspect of control in that it will only request flow on the Loop Demand Side when there is non-zero flow into the heat exchanger on the Loop Supply Side.~ This control mode corresponds to that available in the HeatExchanger:Plate object prior to version 8.0.

  {OperationSchemeModulated}.~ This control mode is applicable to situations where the heat exchanger is controlled by an operation scheme (see objects called PlantEquipmentOperationScheme or CondenserEquipmentOperationSchemes).~ When using this control mode the heat exchanger must be listed in PlantEquipmentList or a CondenserEquipmentList and it serves as a supply component.~ The operation scheme will dispatch a load request to the heat exchanger which it will try meet by conditioning the fluid stream connected as the Loop Supply Side.~ If the heat exchanger could exceed the load request, then the flow through the fluid stream connected as the Loop Demand Side will be modulated to just meet the load request.

  {OperationSchemeOnOff}. This control mode is applicable to situations where the heat exchanger is controlled by an operation scheme (see objects called PlantEquipmentOperationScheme or CondenserEquipmentOperationSchemes).~ When using this control mode the heat exchanger must be listed in PlantEquipmentList or a CondenserEquipmentList and it serves as a supply component.~ The operation scheme will dispatch a load request to the heat exchanger which it will use as an on/off signal to decide if the heat exchange should run or not.~ If it runs, it will run at full capacity and may exceed the load request.

  {HeatingSetpointModulated}.~ This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide useful heating to the Loop Supply Side.~ A heating setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.~ If the setpoint and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Demand Side to the Loop Supply Side to meet the heating setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run.~ The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate. ~If the heat exchanger could overshoot the setpoint, then the flow through the fluid stream connected as the Loop Demand Side will be modulated to just meet the setpoint.

  {HeatingSetpointOnOff}. This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide useful heating to the Loop Supply Side.~ A heating setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.~ If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Demand Side to the Loop Supply Side to meet the heating setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run. The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate. ~If it runs, it will run at full capacity and may overshoot the setpoint.

  {CoolingSetpointModulated}.~ This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide useful cooling to the Loop Supply Side.~ A cooling setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.~ If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Supply Side to the Loop Demand Side to meet the cooling setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run.

  {DualDeadbandSetpointModulated}. This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide either useful cooling or heating to the Loop Supply Side.~ A dual deadband setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.~ If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Demand Side to the Loop Supply Side to meet the lower setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run. If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Supply Side to the Loop Demand Side to meet the high setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run. The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate.~ If the heat exchanger could overshoot the lower setpoint, or undershoot the higher setpoint, then the flow through the fluid stream connected as the Loop Demand Side will be modulated to just meet the deadband setpoint.

  {DualDeadbandSetpointOnOff}. This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide either useful cooling or heating to the Loop Supply Side.~ A dual deadband setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.~ If the setpoints and inlet temperatures are such that heat exchanger could transfer heat from the Loop Demand Side to the Loop Supply Side to meet the lower setpoint, then the heat exchanger will run.

The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate. If the heat exchanger runs, it will run at full capacity and may overshoot the lower setpoint or undershoot the higher setpoint.

  {CoolingDifferentialOnOff}.~ This control mode is applicable to situations where the Loop Demand Side can provide useful cooling to the Loop Supply Side.~ This mode is similar to CoolingSetpointOnOff except that it ignores any cooling setpoint and its control is based only on the temperature difference between Loop Demand Side and the Loop Supply Side.~ The inlet temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate.~ ~This control mode corresponds to that available in the HeatExchanger:WatersideEconomizer object prior to version 8.0.

  {CoolingSetpointOnOffWithComponentOverride}.  This control mode is applicable to situations where the heat exchanger operation is integrated with the operation of a specific chiller.  Typically the heat exchanger and chiller are in parallel on separate branches.  When conditions are favorable for the heat exchanger to provide cooling to the Loop Supply Side, the heat exchanger is run and the integrated chiller is turned off.  When conditions are not favorable, the heat exchanger is competely off and the chiller is allowed to run as usual.  A cooling setpoint is obtained from a node named in the following field.  If it runs it will run at full capacity and may undershoot the setpoint.  The chiller that is integrated with the heat exchanger is identified by entering the names of the chiller's inlet nodes in the input fields below.~ The control decision can be based on one of three different temperature signals selected in the field below called Component Override Cooling Control Temperature Mode.~ The setpoint and control signal temperatures must differ by more than the value set in the field called Minimum Temperature Difference to Activate Heat Exchanger for the heat exchanger to operate.

It can sense one node variable, compare it with its setpoint, and determine the desired value for another node variable. It should be noted that a controller cannot span a loop manager boundary (but a Setpoint Manager can). Thus, in an air loop (AirLoopHVAC), the sensed node and the controlled device must be in the air loop simulation. This means that a single zone system cannot be modeled with a simple controller sensing zone temperature and controlling coil water flow. Instead this must be modeled as a Setpoint Manager sensing a zone temperature and resetting the supply air temperature setpoint each timestep. This is artificial but should simplify the control modeling task. It should also be noted that there are various types of controllers and that each controller might hook into loops in a slightly different way.

Thus, this controller will numerically step through all of the water flow possibilities by an interval-halving technique until the mass flow rate is determined to meet the specified outlet air temperature within a specified user tolerance.

As the reader probably noted when reading the descriptions of the coil syntax shown earlier in this section, there were no controls attached directly to a particular component. This is because the input can be simplified somewhat by entering node names to be controlled. This avoids having to search through multiple lists of component types for the sake of simply controlling components. The Controller:WaterCoil shown below is a way of controlling variables at one node based on conditions at another node. After the identifying name for the controller, the user must define which control variable the controller is managing. These options include Temperature, Humidity Ratio, TemperatureAndHumidityRatio, or Flow.

The next parameter in the input syntax is the Action of the control, which determines how the controlled variable (e.g., mass flow rate through a water coil) is changed based on the control signal. The following input parameter is the actuator variable, which is currently limited to mass flow through a water coil.

The next two parameters in the input syntax are node names corresponding to the node that is being sensed and the actuated node which controls the water mass flow through the coil. For example, in the case of a cooling coil the control variable might be the outlet air temperature of the coil while the actuated variable might be the water flow rate through the coil.

In a cooling coil, an increase in water mass flow rate through the coil decreases the value of heat transfer from the water to the air stream (absolute value increases, but since cooling is traditionally described as a negative number, an increase in absolute value results in a decrease in the actual heat transfer value).

		public static string Note = @"A mixed air box has its own controller type called Controller:OutdoorAir. The purpose of the outdoor air controller is to provide outdoor air for ventilation and also provide free cooling (through additional outdoor air and/or bypassing an air-to-air heat exchanger) whenever possible. The outdoor air controller includes a number of user-selectable limit controls. If any of the selected limits are exceeded, the outdoor airflow rate is set to the minimum.

If all the limits are satisfied, the outdoor air controller does the following for continuous air flow systems: if the outdoor air temperature is greater than or equal to the mixed air temperature setpoint, the outdoor air flow rate is set to the maximum; if the outdoor air temperature is less than the mixed air temperature setpoint, the outdoor air controller will modulate the outdoor air flow so that the mixed air temperature will match the mixed air setpoint temperature.

A time-of-day schedule may also be used to simulate an increase in outdoor air flow rate for push-button type economizer applications. When the schedule permits (i.e., schedule values are greater than 0), the outdoor air flow rate is increased to the user-specified maximum outdoor air flow rate.

The outdoor air controller can also account for changes in the outdoor air flow rate during times when indoor humidity levels are high. A zone humidistat must be used with this control option. During high indoor humidity, the outdoor air flow rate is modified in response to a high indoor humidity condition. If high humidity control is based on the outdoor air humidity ratio and the outdoor humidity ratio is greater than the indoor humidity ratio, high humidity control is terminated. When the economizer is used in conjunction with the high humidity control option, high humidity control has priority and controls the change in air flow rates. The Night Ventilation Availability Manager has priority over high humidity control and will use the controllers maximum outdoor air flow rate when this Availability Manager cycles the fan on (Ref. System Availability Managers AvailabilityManager:NightVentilation)

The mixed air box connections are defined separately in the {OutdoorAir:Mixer} object.

Although the mixer will commonly be connected directly to the outdoor air, other components may be placed on the outdoor air path upstream of the mixer. When this is the case, any modulation will be determined by the conditions at the inlet node of the mixer rather than the outdoor air. This means that the controller will account for any heat recovery or other preheating/precooling components that may modify the condition of outdoor air before it reaches the mixer.

If all the limits are satisfied, the outdoor air controller does the following for cycling fan systems: the outdoor air flow rate is set to the maximum when the fan cycles on. If the limits are not satisfied, the outdoor air flow rate is at the minimum when the fan cycles on.

There are various minimum and maximum limits on the outdoor air flow rate which are applied in the following order. Limits that fall later in the list can override earlier limits.



  OA flow rate = Minimum Outdoor Air Flow Rate * Minimum Outdoor Air Schedule
  Apply economizer controls
  OA flow rate \ge Controller:MechanicalVentilation OA flow rate
  OA flow rate \ge System exhaust flow rate
  (OA flow rate)/(Current mixed air flow rate) \ge Minimum Fraction of Outdoor Air Schedule
  (OA flow rate)/(Current mixed air flow rate) \le Maximum Fraction of Outdoor Air Schedule (even if this reduces the OA flow rate, can override all minimums and economizer)
  OA flow rate \le Maximum Outdoor Air Flow Rate
  Apply OA flow rate specified by demand limiting
  Apply OA flow rate specified by EMS

Choosing {NoEconomizer} means the economizer will not operate and the outdoor airflow rate will be at the minimum for the entire simulation.

Choosing {FixedDryBulb} means the economizer will set the outdoor airflow rate at minimum if the outdoor air temperature is higher than a specified dry-bulb temperature limit.

Choosing {DifferentialDryBulb} will trigger the outdoor airflow to minimum when the dry-bulb temperature of outdoor air is higher than the dry-bulb temperature of the return air.

{FixedEnthalpy} checks the upper limit of the enthalpy given as a field input against the enthalpy content of outdoor air and will set the outdoor airflow rate to minimum if the latter is greater than the former.

{DifferentialEnthalpy} does the same thing but compares the return air enthalpy with the enthalpy of outdoor air. When the enthalpy of outdoor air is greater than the enthalpy of the return air, the outdoor air flow rate is set to minimum.

Choosing {ElectronicEnthalpy} enables the simulation to calculate the humidity ratio limit of outdoor air based on the dry-bulb temperature of outdoor air and a quadratic/cubic curve, and compare it to the actual outdoor air humidity ratio. If the actual outdoor humidity ratio is greater than the calculated humidity ratio limit, then the outdoor airflow rate is set to minimum.

Choosing {FixedDewPointAndDryBulb} compares both the outdoor dewpoint temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature to their specified high limit values. If either outdoor temperature exceeds the high limit value, the outdoor airflow rate is set to minimum.

Another option {DifferentialDryBulbAndEnthalpy} enables the control strategy to be based on both the DifferentialDryBulb and DifferentialEnthalpy economizer control strategies.

In addition to all economizer control types listed above, each control type checks for user-entered values for the upper limit of dry-bulb temperature, enthalpy limit, humidity ratio limit and dewpoint limit. The outdoor air flow rate is set to minimum if any of these entered limits are exceeded.

The MinimumFlowWithBypass choice forces the outdoor air flow rate to always remain at the minimum. However, when high humidity control is used, the outdoor air flow rate is set to the product of the maximum outdoor air flow rate multiplied by the high humidity outdoor air flow ratio. The heat exchanger uses the limit checking in the outdoor air controller to decide whether or not to bypass the outdoor air around the heat exchanger or turn off the wheel motor in the case of a rotary heat exchanger.

Ventilation standards provide guidance on appropriate levels of outdoor ventilation air required for acceptable indoor air quality. The Ventilation Rate Procedure (VRP) of ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007/2010 (\href{http://www.ashrae.org}{www.ashrae.org}) requires outdoor ventilation rates to be determined based on the floor area of each occupied zone plus the number of people in each zone and considers the zone air distribution effectiveness and system ventilation efficiency. The outdoor air ventilation rate can be reset dynamically as operating conditions change (e.g., variations in occupancy). The Controller:MechanicalVentilation object implements the VRP for calculating these outdoor air ventilation requirements and resetting them based on varying occupancy levels and zone diversification. This is particularly useful for large air distribution systems that serve a number of different zone types with varying occupancy levels. This object can also be used to model the Indoor Air Quality Procedure (IAQP) as defined in Standard 62.1

The first five inputs for this object are the name, the availability schedule, the zone outdoor air method, the system outdoor air method, and the zone maximum outdoor air fraction.

Several choices are allowed: {ZoneSum}, {VentilationRateProcedure,} {IndoorAirQualityProcedure, ProportionalControlBasedonOccupancySchedule,} {ProportionalControlBasedonDesignOccupancy,} {ProportionalControlBasedOnDesignOARate,} and {IndoorAirQualityProcedureGenericContaminant}. ZoneSum sums the outdoor air flows across all zones served by the system. VentilationRateProcedure (VRP) uses the multi-zone equations defined in 62.1-2007 to calculate the system outdoor air flow. VRP considers zone air distribution effectiveness and zone diversification of outdoor air fractions. IndoorAirQualityProcedure (IAQP) is the other procedure defined in ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007 for calculate the amount of outdoor air necessary to maintain the levels of indoor air carbon dioxide at or below the setpoint defined in the ZoneControl:ContaminantController object. Appendix A of the ASHRAE 62.1-2010 user's manual discusses another method for implementing CO_{2}-based DCV in a single zone system. This method (Proportional Control) calculates the required outdoor air flow rate which varies in proportion to the percentage of the CO_{2} signal range and has two choices to calculate occupancy-based outdoor air rate. The ProportionalControlBasedonOccupancySchedule choice uses the real occupancy at the current time step to calculate outdoor air rate, while the ProportionalControlBasedonDesignOccupancy uses the design occupancy level to calculate outdoor air rate. The former choice is a good approach to estimate outdoor air rate. However, for practical applications, the zone controller usually does not have the real time occupancy information, and the design occupancy level is assumed. The latter choice is used in the design stage. The ProportionalControlBasedOnDesignOARate uses design outdoor air flow rate to calculate demand outdoor air flow rate. The IndoorAirQualityProcedure-GenericContaminant method calculates the amount of outdoor air necessary to maintain the levels of indoor air generic contaminant at or below the setpoint defined in the ZoneControl:ContaminantController object.

The purpose of this controller is to simulate economizer operation for the stand alone ERV and provide free cooling whenever possible or modify the outdoor air flow rate during high indoor humidity conditions. During economizer operation, if all of the limits are satisfied, the controller activates economizer mode (fully bypassing the fixed-plate air-to-air heat exchanger or stopping the rotation of a rotary heat exchanger). If any of the selected limits are exceeded, economizer operation is terminated. A time-of-day schedule may also be used to simulate a push-button type economizer controller.

In addition, the outdoor air flow rate may be modified and heat exchange suspended in response to high indoor relative humidities. When the indoor relative humidity exceeds the zone humidistat s relative humidity set point, high humidity control is activated. When activated, if high humidity control is based on the outdoor air humidity ratio and the outdoor humidity ratio is greater than the indoor humidity ratio, high humidity control is terminated.

The sensible and latent air-to-air heat exchanger is an HVAC component typically used for exhaust or relief air heat recovery (Figure 150). Heat exchanger performance can be specified to transfer sensible energy, latent energy or both between the supply and exhaust air streams. The input requires no geometric data. Performance is defined by specifying sensible and/or latent effectiveness at 75% and 100% of the nominal (rated) supply air flow rate at two operating conditions as shown in Table~\ref{table:operating-conditions-for-defining-heat}.

This object models the basic operation of an air-to-air heat exchanger. Heat exchange between the supply and exhaust air streams occurs whenever the unit is scheduled to be available (Availability schedule) and supply/exhaust air flow is present. This heat exchanger object can be used in conjunction with a conventional air-side economizer (i.e., specify ModulateFlow in the Controller:OutdoorAir object), whereby heat exchange is suspended whenever the air-side economizer (or high humidity control) is active (i.e., air flow is fully bypassed around a fixed-plate heat exchanger or the rotation of a rotary heat exchanger is stopped). This object is also able to suspend heat exchange for the purpose of providing free cooling operation in the absence of a conventional air-side economizer (i.e., specify MinimumFlowWithBypass in the Controller:OutdoorAir object).

During winter weather, humid exhaust air entering the heat exchanger can form frost on the cold heat exchanger surfaces, which can reduce air flow and the amount of energy recovery. Several methods are used to control or eliminate frost formation, and the following types can be modeled for this heat exchanger object: supply air preheat, minimum exhaust air temperature, exhaust air recirculation and exhaust only. For preheat frost control, a separate heating coil object must be placed in the supply inlet air stream to keep the air temperature above the frost threshold temperature. The other frost control types are modeled within this object itself (i.e., do not require a separate object to be defined) based on alpha and numeric inputs to this heat exchanger object.

Air-to-air heat exchangers are sometimes controlled to maintain a fixed supply air outlet temperature to avoid overheating when the heat exchanger is heating the supply (primary) air. To model this control in EnergyPlus, a set point manager object is used to establish a temperature set point at the supply air outlet node of the heat exchanger. Wheel speed modulation or plate supply air bypass is used to control the supply air exiting conditions to this set point. The set point for supply air temperature control should be set at the minimum economizer temperature set point if an air-side economizer is also being used by the air system. If frost control and supply air outlet temperature control are used, frost control takes precedence over supply air temperature control (e.g., frost control defrost time fraction is determined as if wheel speed modulation or plate supply air bypass is not used).

To model a sensible and latent air-to-air heat exchanger located in an air loop, the input data file should include the following objects:



  AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem

  Controller:OutdoorAir

  OutdoorAir:Mixer

  HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent

  Coil:Heating:Water, Coil:Heating:Electric or Coil:Heating:Fuel (if preheat frost control is to be modeled)

  SetpointManager:Scheduled (if supply air outlet temperature control is used)


The sensible and latent air-to-air heat exchanger can also be used in a number of other applications, including conditioning outdoor ventilation air and supplying it directly to a zone without an air loop. See object ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator for further details on this specific application.

For plate exchangers, air bypass around the heat exchanger is used to obtain the desired effect.";
		public static string Field_FrostControlType = @"This alpha field has four choices: None, ExhaustAirRecirculation, ExhaustOnly and MinimumExhaustTemperature. If this field is left blank, the default frost control type is None . For modeling preheat frost control, specify None for this input field and insert a separate heating coil object in the supply inlet air stream to keep the air temperature above the desired frost threshold temperature.

{ExhaustAirRecirculation}: dampers are used to direct exhaust air back into the zone through the supply side of the heat exchanger when the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature falls below a threshold temperature (defined in the next input field). The fraction of time that exhaust air is circulated through the supply side of the heat exchanger is dependent on the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature with respect to the threshold temperature, the initial defrost time fraction, and the rate of change of defrost time fraction (see {Field: Rate of Defrost Time Fraction Increase}). When exhaust air is being recirculated, no supply (outdoor ventilation) air is being provided through the heat exchanger unit (which may or may not be acceptable regarding ventilation for occupants).

{ExhaustOnly (supply air bypass)}: this control cycles off the supply air flow through the heat exchanger for a certain period of time while the exhaust air continues to flow through the exhaust side of the heat exchanger. The fraction of time that the supply flow through the heat exchanger is cycled off is dependent on the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature with respect to the threshold temperature, the initial defrost time fraction, and the rate of change of defrost time fraction (see {Field: Rate of Defrost Time Fraction Increase}). When implemented in real applications, provisions are usually made to avoid building depressurization when this frost control is operating (automatic or pressure-operated dampers, or a bypass air damper around the supply side of the heat exchanger). For this frost control type, it is assumed that the supply air is bypassed around the heat exchanger during frost control operation (i.e., the total supply flow is not reduced during defrost, but merely bypassed around the heat exchanger).

{MinimumExhaustTemperature}: the temperature of the exhaust air leaving the heat exchanger is monitored and the heat exchanger effectiveness is decreased (by slowing heat exchanger rotation or bypassing supply air around the plate exchanger) to keep the exhaust air from falling below the threshold temperature.";
		public static string Field_ThresholdTemperature = @"This numeric field defines the dry-bulb temperature of air which is used to initiate frost control. The default value is 1.7 ??C. For ExhaustAirRecirculation and ExhaustOnly frost control, the threshold temperature defines the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature below which frost control is active. For MinimumExhaustTemperature frost control, heat exchanger effectiveness is controlled to keep the exhaust air outlet temperature from falling below this threshold temperature value.

The appropriate threshold temperature varies with exhaust (inlet) air temperature and humidity, frost control type, heat exchanger type, and whether the heat exchanger transfers sensible energy alone or both sensible and latent energy (enthalpy). Typical threshold temperatures are provided in Table~\ref{table:typical-threshold-temperatures} below. However, it is recommended that the user consult manufacturer s information for the specific air-to-air heat exchanger being modeled.

Currently, this desiccant heat exchanger model can be referenced by two compound objects: CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted and Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System, both of which are used to provide enhanced dehumidification over conventional systems. If this heat exchanger is referenced by a compound object, the compound object will control heat exchanger operation (i.e., tell the heat exchanger if heat exchange is needed or not for each simulation timestep).

This desiccant heat exchanger object may also be specified directly in an AirLoopHVAC (air loop BranchList) or in an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem (AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList) without being referenced by a compound object. If specified directly in an AirLoopHVAC or AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem, then the heat exchanger can be controlled to provide heat exchange based on a maximum and/or minimum humidity set point placed on the process air outlet node (ref. Setpoint Managers). If no humidity set points are provided on this node, then heat exchange will be provided whenever the heat exchanger is available to operate (via its availability schedule) and there is a temperature and/or humidity ratio difference between the two air streams.

A HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow object will reference a HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1 object. This performance data object is used to specify the thermal performance and electric consumption of the heat exchanger. Some representative inputs for this object are provided in the EnergyPlus Reference DataSets (PerfCurves.idf and AllDataSets.idf).

This model predicts the regeneration air stream outlet temperature and humidity ratio values based on the entering regeneration and process air stream temperature, humidity ratio and face velocity. The process air stream outlet humidity ratio and temperatures are calculated based on a simple heat and moisture balance. The model requires that the user enter the nominal volumetric flow rate and a nominal face velocity, electric power consumption, empirical model coefficients for the regeneration outlet air temperature and humidity ratio equations, and the applicable minimum and maximum values for both the independent and dependent variables for the empirical model coefficients provided. This model is based on the following equations:




  The dry-bulb temperature of the regeneration outlet air is defined using the following equation:



RTO = B1 + B2*RWI + B3*RTI + B4*\left( {\frac{{RWI}}{{RTI}}} \right) + B5*PWI + B6*PTI + B7*\left( {\frac{{PWI}}{{PTI}}} \right) + B8*RFV


where,

RTO = Regeneration outlet air dry-bulb temperature (C)

RWI = Regeneration inlet air humidity ratio (kgWater/kgDryAir)

RTI = Regeneration inlet air dry-bulb temperature (C)

PWI = Process inlet air humidity ratio (kgWater/kgDryAir)

PTI = Process inlet air dry-bulb temperature (C)

RFV = Regeneration (and process) face velocity (m/s)




  The humidity ratio of the regeneration outlet air is defined using the same empirical equation form; however, different coefficients are used as follows:



RWO = C1 + C2*RWI + C3*RTI + C4*\left( {\frac{{RWI}}{{RTI}}} \right) + C5*PWI + C6*PTI + C7*\left( {\frac{{PWI}}{{PTI}}} \right) + C8*RFV


where,

RWO = Regeneration outlet air humidity ratio (kgWater/kgDryAir)




  The process outlet air conditions are then calculated based on the regeneration outlet air conditions (temperature or humidity ratio) calculated above, the actual regeneration inlet air conditions entering the heat exchanger, and assuming the same amount of sensible and total energy transfer across both the process and regeneration sides of the heat exchanger. The difference between the actual inlet air conditions and RTI/RWI/PTI/PWI is made here because user-defined limits for RTI/RWI/PTI/PWI may result in a difference between the actual conditions and those used in the equations shown above (see the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference for further discussion).

The coil is sized using auto-sized/user design input conditions and the UA values are calculated from the design conditions. A rough estimate of the coil area is provided along with percentage of surface wet and/or dry. This model uses the NTU-effectiveness approach to model heat transfer and has two types of flow arrangements cross-flow or counter-flow.

The basic underlying idea is - use auto sizable thermodynamic design inputs, calculate the coil UA s, use these UA values and operating conditions from the nodes connections, calculate the outlet stream conditions, and calculate the heat transfer rates.

The desuperheater heating coil input requires a coil name, an availability schedule, and a heat reclaim recovery efficiency. The reclaim recovery efficiency determines the amount of heat available for use by this heating coil. Approximately 25-30% of the energy rejected by typical refrigeration system condensers is to reduce the superheated refrigerant vapor temperature to the condensing temperature. Recovery efficiencies higher than 30% may cause the refrigerant gas to condense which in turn impacts the performance of the refrigeration system. For this reason, the maximum heat reclaim recovery efficiency for this coil is 30% for most sources of waste heat, including refrigeration compressor racks. The one exception to this 30% limit is a condenser that is part of a detailed refrigeration system. In a detailed refrigeration system, the portion of the rejected heat that lies within the superheated region is explicitly calculated. Therefore, the desuperheater coils supplied by a condenser attached to a detailed refrigeration system are subject to a maximum reclaim recovery efficiency of 90% of the heat within the superheated region.

The next two input items for the desuperheater heating coil are the node names for the inlet and outlet air streams. The following two input fields define the source of heating energy for the coil. This desuperheater heating coil may only be used with direct expansion (DX) cooling or refrigeration equipment. The first of these two inputs is the heating source object type while the second defines the name of the heating source. For proper modeling, the desuperheater heating coil must be placed downstream of a DX cooling coil when reclaiming heat from that cooling coil. Desuperheating heating coil placement is unrestricted when reclaiming heat from a Refrigeration:CompressorRack or Refrigeration:Condenser.

The next input field is optional and defines the set point node name if the desuperheater heating coil is to be controlled based on temperature. When a load-based control scheme is used, this field is left blank. A final optional input is used to model parasitic electric energy use of auxiliary equipment associated with the desuperheater heating coil (e.g., solenoid valve).

		public static string Note = @"The variable refrigerant flow (VRF) DX heating coil model uses performance information at rated conditions along with performance curves for variations in total capacity, energy input ratio and part load fraction to determine performance at part-load conditions. The impacts of defrost operation is modeled based a combination of user inputs and empirical models taken from the air-to-air heat pump algorithms in DOE-2.1E.

The VRF DX heating coil input requires an availability schedule, the gross rated heating capacity and the rated air volume flow rate. The rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00008056 m^{3}/s and 0.00002684 m^{3}/s per watt of gross rated heating capacity. 

Two performance curves are required. The first performance curve defines the heating capacity as a function of indoor air dry-bulb and outdoor condenser entering air dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperature. The outdoor air temperature type is specified in the variable refrigerant flow air-to-air heat pump object. The second performance curve defines the change in heating capacity as a function of air flow fraction. Each of these performance curves are further discussed here.





  Heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature, specified in Heat Pump)


The heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor wet-bulb temperature and indoor air dry-bulb temperature. The curve is normalized to 1 at 21.11 C indoor dry-bulb temperature and if a biquadratic curve is used also at 6.11 C outdoor wet-bulb or 8.33 outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The outdoor air temperature type is specified in the variable refrigerant flow air-to-air heat pump object. Users have the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a tri-quadratic curve with three independent variable. The tri-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the combined total capacity of all indoor units connected to the heat pump condenser and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity to give the gross heating capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature) and the combination ratio of the installed system.

The latter 4 inputs determine the coil performance at the rating point (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7 ??C drybulb/19.4 ??C wetbulb and air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35 ??C drybulb/23.9 ??C wetbulb). The rated air volume flow rate should be between .00004027 m^{3}/s and .00006041 m^{3}/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (300 to 450 cfm/ton).

The rated volumetric air flow to total cooling capacity ratio for 100% dedicated outdoor air (DOAS) application DX cooling coils should be between 0.00001677 (m3/s)/W (125 cfm/ton) and 0.00003355 (m3/s)/W (250 cfm/ton).

Pumped refrigerant economizer integrated with the single speed DX cooling coil model will use exactly the same model except that performance curves use lookup table to cover the pumped refrigerant economizer and the compressor operating ranges. One or two independent variables may used to represent the performance data.

This model requires 5 curves as follows:


\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

  The total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) is a curve with two independent variables: wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44 C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35 C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). This curve is typically a biquadratic but any curve or table with two independent variables can be used.

  The total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a curve or lookup table with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variables can be used.

  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) is a curve with two independent variables: wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44 C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35 C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). This curve is typically a biquadratic but any curve or table with two independent variables can be used.

  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a curve or lookup table with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variables can be used.

  The part load fraction correlation (function of part load ratio) is a curve or a lookup table with the independent variable being part load ratio (sensible cooling load / steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The curve should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variables can be used.


The curves are simply specified by name. Curve inputs are described in the curve manager section of this document (see Performance Curves in this document).

The next four input fields are optional and relate to the degradation of latent cooling capacity when the supply air fan operates continuously while the cooling coil/compressor cycle on and off to meet the cooling load. The fan operating mode is determined in the partent object and is considered to either be constant (e.g.~CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled (e.g.~AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool). When scheduled, the schedule value must be greater than 0 to calculate degradation of latent cooling capacity. At times when the parent object s supply air fan operating mode schedule is 0, latent degradation will be ignored. When modeling latent capacity degradation, these next four input fields must all have positive values.

The next input specifies the outdoor air node used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is left blank, the outdoor temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must be listed in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name must be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data.

The next input describes the type of outdoor condenser coil used with the DX cooling coil (Air Cooled or Evap Cooled). The following three inputs are required when modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser: evaporative condenser effectiveness, evaporative condenser air volume flow rate, and the power consumed by the evaporative condenser pump. Crankcase heater capacity and cutout temperature are entered in the next two input fields. These two fields for this object define the name of the water storage tank for supply and condensate collection. See section DX Cooling Coil Model in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details regarding this model.

The last two input fields following the Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name are the Sensible Heat Ratio (SHR) modifier cruve names for temperature and flow fraction. These two input fields are optional and used only when a user intends to override SHR calculated using the apparatus dew point (ADP) and bypass factor (BF) method. See section SHR Calculation Using User Specified SHR Modifier Curves in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details.

The single speed unit is described by single full load capacity, SHR, COP, and air flow rate at rated conditions. Off rated full load performance is obtained by the use of 4 modifier curves. At partial load the unit cycles on/off and the cycling losses are described by a part load fraction curve.

The multispeed unit is described by specifying the performance at two states: high speed compressor, high speed fan; and low speed compressor, low speed fan. When the unit load is above the high speed capacity, the unit runs with high speed compressor and fan. When the load on the unit is below the high speed capacity but above the low speed capacity, the unit will run with performance intermediate between high speed and low speed. When the load is less than the low speed capacity, the unit will cycle on/off just like the single speed unit.

The multispeed unit model requires 2 full sets of performance data. There must be a high and low speed capacity, SHR, COP, and evaporator air flow rate; as well as high and low speed performance curves total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) and energy input ratio modifier curve (function of temperature).

		public static string Field_PartLoadFractionCorrelationCurveName = @"This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.

The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 < = PLR < 1), the following rules apply:

PLF > = 0.7 and PLF > = PLR

If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.

A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:


       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)


If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:

Depending on input choices, the user can model a single compressor with multiple operating speeds, or a unit with a single cooling coil fed by multiple compressors (e.g., row split or intertwined coil circuiting). Currently, this cooling coil can only be referenced by a AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:Multispeed object. Refer to Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode if the user wishes to model a cooling coil with discrete levels of cooling and the possibility of air bypass during low speed operation (e.g.~face-split coil circuiting), or if cooling coil operation based on dehumidification requirements is desired.

The multispeed DX cooling coil can have from two to four operating speeds. When the coil operates at Speed 1 (the lowest speed), its performance is very similar to the single speed DX coil where the impacts of part-load ratio and latent capacity degradation can be included. When the coil operates at higher speeds (above Speed 1), the linear approximation methodology is applied. The coil outputs at two consecutive speeds are linearly interpolated to meet the required cooling capacity during an HVAC system timestep. When the coil performs above the lowest speed, the user can chose if they want to include part-load ratio and latent capacity degradation impacts at the higher speeds.

The multispeed unit is described by specifying the performance at different operating speeds. Each speed has its own set of input specifications: full load capacity, SHR, COP and air flow rate at rated conditions, along with modifier curves to determine performance when actual operating conditions are different from the rated conditions.

The coil operates to meet the sensible capacity being requested. When this requested capacity is above the sensible capacity of the highest operating speed, the coil runs continuously at the highest speed. When the requested capacity is between the sensible capacities of two consecutive speeds, the unit will operate a portion of the time at each speed to meet the request. When the requested capacity is less than the low speed (Speed 1) capacity, the unit will cycle on/off as needed.

If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.

A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional DX cooling coil (Speed <x>) would be:

The performance curves should be generated from a Reference Unit data. This is an equation-fit model that resembles a black box with no usage of heat transfer equations. On the other hand, the model uses the bypass factor approach to calculate sensible heat transfer rate, similar to the one used in the single-speed DX coil. The number of speed levels can range from 1 to 10. The cooling coil has two indoor air side connections, and one optional condenser air node connection. The user needs to specify a nominal speed level, at which the gross rated total cooling capacity, and rated volumetric air rate are sized. The rated capacity and rated volumetric flow rate represent the real situation in the air loop, and are used to determine and flow rates at various speed levels in the parent objects, e.g.~of AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool, ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalAirConditioner, AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir and ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump. It shall be mentioned that the performance correction curves, i.e.~the temperature and flow fraction correction curves, should be normalized to the capacity and flow rate at each individual speed and at the rated conditions, similar to the performance curves used in the single-speed DX coil. However, the performance values, e.g.~capacities, COPs, SHRs and flow rates at individual speed levels, should be given regarding a specific unit from the Reference Unit catalog data. In the following content, the statement started with Reference Unit means the actual Reference Unit catalog data. The rated conditions for obtaining the capacities, COPs and SHRs are at indoor dry-bulb temperature of 26.67 ??C (80 ??F), wet bulb temperature of 19.44 ??C (67 ??F), and the condenser entering air temperature of 35 ??C (95 ??F).

    { 
		public static string Name = @"CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling";
		public static string Note = @"This coil performance object is used to specify DX coil performance for one mode of operation for a Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode. A single Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode object will reference one to four CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling objects depending on the number of available stages and dehumidification modes as specified in the two stage DX object. For example, a standard 2-stage DX system will use two of these performance objects, one to defined the capacity and performance for stage 1 operation, and a second one for stage 1+2 (both stages active) operation. In nearly all cases, the Rated Air Volume Flow Rate will be the same for all performance objects associated with a given multimode DX coil. If bypass is specified, the Rated Air Volume Flow Rate includes both the bypassed flow and the flow through the active coil.

This DX coil model is identical to Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed with addition of bypass and multi-stage capabilities. This DX cooling coil model and input are quite different from that for the heating and cooling water coils. The simple water coils use an NTU-effectiveness heat exchanger model. The single speed DX coil model uses performance information at rated conditions along with curve fits for variations in total capacity, energy input ratio and part-load fraction to determine performance at part-load conditions. Sensible/latent capacity splits are determined by the rated sensible heat ratio (SHR) and the apparatus dewpoint/bypass factor (ADP/BF) approach. This approach is analogous to the NTU-effectiveness calculations used for sensible-only heat exchanger calculations, extended to a cooling and dehumidifying coil.

An alternative to ADP/BF method for sensible/latent capacity split is to use SHR modifier curves for temperature and flow fraction. These two optional input fields are used only when a user specified SHR calculation method desired over the (ADP/BF) method. Sensible heat ratio calculated using these two SHR modifier curves override the value calculated by ADP/BF method. See section SHR Calculation Using User Specified SHR Modifier Curves in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details.

The DX cooling coil input requires the gross rated total cooling capacity, the gross rated SHR, the gross rated COP, the rated air volume flow rate, and the fraction of air flow which is bypassed around the coil. The first 4 inputs determine the coil performance at the rating point (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7 ??C drybulb/19.4 ??C wetbulb and air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35 ??C drybulb/23.9 ??C wetbulb). The rated air volume flow rate (less any bypassed fraction) should be between .00004027 m^{3}/s and .00006041 m^{3}/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (300 to 450 cfm/ton). The rated volumetric air flow to gross total cooling capacity ratio for 100% dedicated outdoor air (DOAS) application DX cooling coils should be between 0.00001677 (m3/s)/W (125 cfm/ton) and 0.00003355 (m3/s)/W (250 cfm/ton).

This model requires 5 curves as follows:


\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

  The total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) is a biquadratic curve with two independent variables: wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44 C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35 C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures).

  The total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.

  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) is a biquadratic curve with two independent variables: wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The curve is normalized to 1 at 19.44 C indoor wet-bulb temperature and 35 C outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures).

  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.

  The part load fraction correlation (function of part load ratio) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being part load ratio (sensible cooling load / steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The curve should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep).


The curves are simply specified by name. Curve inputs are described in the curve manager section of this document (see Performance Curves in this document).

The next four input fields are optional and relate to the degradation of latent cooling capacity when the supply air fan operates continuously while the cooling coil/compressor cycle on and off to meet the cooling load. The fan operating mode is either considered to be constant (e.g.~CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in the parent object (e.g.~AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool). When scheduled, the schedule value must be greater than 0 to calculate degradation of latent cooling capacity. At times when the parent object s supply air fan operating mode schedule is 0, latent degradation will be ignored. When used, these next four input fields must all have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.

The next input specifies the outdoor air node used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must be listed in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name must be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data. This field may also be left blank, if this is the case then the outdoor temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data.

The next input describes the type of outdoor condenser coil used with the DX cooling coil (Air Cooled or Evap Cooled). The following three inputs are required when modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser: evaporative condenser effectiveness, evaporative condenser air volume flow rate, and the power consumed by the evaporative condenser pump. See section DX Cooling Coil Model in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details regarding this model.

For DOAS applications the remaining portion of rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00001677 m^{3}/s and 0.00003355 m^{3}/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (125 to 250 cfm/ton). This is used to model face-split coils on multi-stage units or bypass dampers. If total flow rate varies during simulation, the same fraction is bypassed. This input may range from 0.0 to <1.0. The default is 0.0. For a multi-stage face-split coil in which stage 1 is 60% of total capacity, this field would be set to 0.4 for the Stage 1 performance and set to 0.0 for the Stage 1+2 performance.

The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.

The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 < = PLR < 1), the following rules apply:

PLF > = 0.7 and PLF > = PLR

If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.

A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:


       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)


If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:

		public static string Name = @"Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed";
		public static string Note = @"The single speed heating DX coil model uses performance information at rated conditions along with curve fits for variations in total capacity, energy input ratio and part load fraction to determine performance at part-load conditions. The impacts of various defrost strategies (reverse cycle, resistive, timed or on-demand) are modeled based on a combination of user inputs and empirical models taken from the air-to-air heat pump algorithms in DOE-2.1E.

The single speed heating DX coil input requires an availability schedule, the gross rated heating capacity, the gross rated COP and the rated air volume flow rate. The latter 3 inputs determine the coil performance at the rating point (outdoor air dry-bulb temperature of 8.33 C, outdoor air wet-bulb temperature of 6.11 C, coil entering air dry-bulb temperature of 21.11 C, coil entering air wet-bulb temperature of 15.55 C). The rated air volume flow rate should be between .00004027 m^{3}/s and .00006041 m^{3}/s per watt of gross rated heating capacity.

Up to 6 curves are required depending on the defrost strategy selected.




  The heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperature or only the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature. User has the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a quadratic curve as well as a cubic curve with a single independent variable. The curve is normalized to 1 at 8.33 outdoor dry-bulb temperature and if a biquadratic curve is used also at 21.11 C indoor dry-bulb temperature. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity to give the gross heating capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature).

  The heating capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity and the heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross heating capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.

  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperature or only the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature. User has the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a quadratic curve as well as a cubic curve with a single independent variable. The curve is normalized to 1 at 8.33 outdoor dry-bulb temperature and if a biquadratic curve is used also at 21.11 C indoor dry-bulb temperature. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature).

  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.

  The part load fraction correlation (function of part load ratio) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being part load ratio (sensible heating load / steady-state heating capacity). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.

  The defrost energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) is a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables: the heating coil entering air wet-bulb temperature (variable x) and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (variable y). The output of this curve is multiplied by the heating coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the coil is operating. This curve is only required when a reverse-cycle defrost strategy is specified.


The curves are simply specified by name. Curve inputs are described in the curve manager section of this document (ref. Performance Curves).

The next input item for the coil is the supply air fan operation mode. Either the supply air fan runs continuously while the DX coil cycles on/off, or the fan and coil cycle on/off together. The next two inputs define the minimum outdoor dry-bulb temperature that the heat pump compressor will operate and the maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature for defrost operation. Crankcase heater capacity and cutout temperature are entered in the following two inputs. The final four inputs cover the type of defrost strategy (reverse-cycle or resistive), defrost control (timed or on-demand), the fractional defrost time period (timed defrost control only), and the resistive defrost heater capacity if a resistive defrost strategy is selected.

If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.

A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:


       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)


If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:


       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)";

		public static string Name = @"Coil:Heating:DX:MultiSpeed";
		public static string Note = @"This component models a DX heating unit with multiple discrete levels of heating capacity. Currently, this heating coil can only be referenced by a AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed compound object. The multispeed DX heating coil can have from two to four operating speeds. When the coil operates at Speed 1 (the lowest speed), its performance is very similar to the Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed object where the impacts of part-load ratio can be included. When the coil operates at higher speeds (above Speed 1), the linear approximation methodology is applied. The coil outputs at two consecutive speeds are linearly interpolated to meet the required heating capacity during an HVAC system timestep. When the coil performs above the lowest speed, the user can choose if they want to include part-load ratio impacts at the higher speeds.

The multispeed unit is described by specifying the performance at different operating speeds. Each speed has its own set of input specifications: full load capacity, COP and air flow rate at rated conditions, along with modifier curves to determine performance when actual operating conditions are different from the rated conditions.

The coil operates to meet the sensible capacity being requested. When this requested capacity is above the sensible capacity of the highest operating speed, the coil runs continuously at the highest speed. When the requested capacity is between the sensible capacities of two consecutive speeds, the unit will operate a portion of the time at each speed to meet the request. When the requested capacity is less than the low speed (Speed 1) capacity, the unit will cycle on/off as needed.

The next input defines the minimum outdoor dry-bulb temperature where the compressor will operate. The followed two inputs are related to crankcase heater operation: capacity and maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature for crankcase heater operation. The next six inputs cover defrost operation: defrost EIR modifier curve, the maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature for defrost operation, the type of defrost strategy (reverse-cycle or resistive), defrost control (timed or on-demand), the fractional defrost time period (timed defrost control only), and the resistive defrost heater capacity if a resistive defrost strategy is selected. The activation of defrost is dependent on outdoor conditions. The capacity reduction and energy use modification are independent of speed. The defrost EIR modifier is described below:

The defrost energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) is a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables: the heating coil entering air wet-bulb temperature (variable x) and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (variable y). The output of this curve is multiplied by the heating coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the coil is operating. This curve is only required when a reverse-cycle defrost strategy is specified.

The next input allows the user to choose whether to apply the part load fraction correlation to speeds greater than 1 or not. The following input is the type of fuel.

Then the number of speed for heating is entered. The rest of inputs are speed dependent. Each set of data consists of gross rated heating capacity, gross rated COP, and the rated air volume flow rate. These three inputs determine the coil performance at the rating point (outdoor air dry-bulb temperature of 8.33 ??C, outdoor air wet-bulb temperature of 6.11 ??C, coil entering air dry-bulb temperature of 21.11 ??C, coil entering air wet-bulb temperature of 15.55 ??C). The rated air volume flow rate should be between .00004027 m^{3}/s and .00006041 m^{3}/s per watt of gross rated heating capacity. The rated waste heat fraction is needed to calculate how much waste heat is available at the rated conditions. In addition, up to 6 modifier curves are required per speed.




  The heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperature or only the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature. User has the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a quadratic curve as well as a cubic curve with a single independent variable. The curve is normalized to 1 at 8.33 outdoor dry-bulb temperature and if a biquadratic curve is used also at 21.11 C indoor dry-bulb temperature. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity to give the gross total heating capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature).

  The heating capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity and the heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross heating capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.

  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperature or only the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature. User has the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a quadratic curve as well as a cubic curve with a single independent variable. The curve is normalized to 1 at 8.33 outdoor dry-bulb temperature and if a biquadratic curve is used also at 21.11 C indoor dry-bulb temperature. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature).

  The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.

  The part load fraction correlation (function of part load ratio) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being part load ratio (sensible heating load / steady-state heating capacity). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.

  The waste heat modifier curve (function of temperature) is a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables: outdoor air dry-bulb temperature and the heating coil entering air dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the heating input energy, the waste heat fraction of heat input to give the recoverable waste heat.


The curves are simply specified by name. Curve inputs are described in the curve manager section of this document (ref. Performance Curves).

The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.

The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.

The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 < = PLR < 1), the following rules apply:


       PLF > = 0.7     and     PLF > = PLR


If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.

A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional DX heating coil (Speed <x>) would be:


       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)


If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:

    { 
		public static string Name = @"Coil:WaterHeating:Desuperheater";
		public static string Note = @"A simplified approach is used to determine the performance of this water heating coil. The model assumes that the heating energy provided by this coil is reclaimed from the superheated refrigerant gas leaving a compressor (i.e., a desuperheating refrigerant-to-water heating coil) and does not impact the performance of the compressor. This coil must be used with a water heater tank (e.g., WaterHeater:Mixed) which can supply heated potable water and/or hot water for use in a plant loop (e.g., hydronic air reheat coils).

Except for detailed refrigeration system models, the amount of available superheat is simply a percentage of the total heat being rejected by the DX system's condenser. Approximately 25-30% of the energy rejected by typical refrigeration system condensers is to reduce the superheated refrigerant vapor temperature to the condensing temperature. Recovery efficiencies higher than 30% may cause the refrigerant gas to condense which in turn impacts the performance of the refrigeration system. For this reason, the maximum heat reclaim recovery efficiency for this coil is 30% for most sources of waste heat, including refrigeration compressor racks. The one exception to this 30% limit is a condenser that is part of a detailed refrigeration system. In a detailed refrigeration system, the portion of the rejected heat that lies within the superheated region is explicitly calculated. Therefore, the desuperheater coils supplied by a condenser attached to a detailed refrigeration system are subject to a maximum reclaim recovery efficiency of 90% of the heat within the superheated region.

The model includes the ability to modify the heat reclaim recovery efficiency based on variations in inlet water temperature and outdoor air dry-bulb temperature.

This coil model performs the following major functions:



  calculates the amount of heat delivered to the water tank

  calculates the electricity consumption of the integral water pump and on/off-cycle parasitic loads


The input fields for this object are described below in detail:
";

		public static string Field_AvailabilityScheduleName = @"This alpha field contains the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the desuperheater coil is available to operate during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the desuperheater coil is off for that time period. A value other than 0 denotes that the desuperheater coil is available to operate during that time period. During times when the desuperheater coil is scheduled off, the heater (element or burner) in the water tank object operates based on its tank set point temperature schedule and the desuperheater coil s parasitic electric power is also off for that time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.";
		public static string Field_SetpointTemperatureScheduleName = @"This alpha field contains the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that specifies the set point (or cut-out ) temperature for the desuperheater coil. Temperature values used in this schedule should be in degrees Celsius. The desuperheater coil turns off when the tank water reaches this set point temperature. Once the desuperheater coil is off, the tank water temperature floats downward until it falls below the set point temperature minus the dead band temperature difference defined below (i.e., the cut-in temperature). At this point, the desuperheater coil turns on and remains on until the desuperheater coil set point temperature is reached.";
		public static string Field_DeadBandTemperatureDifference = @"This numeric field contains the dead band temperature difference in degrees Celsius. The desuperheater coil cut-in temperature is defined as the desuperheater coil set point temperature defined above minus this dead band temperature difference. The desuperheater coil turns on when the water temperature in the tank falls below the cut-in temperature. The desuperheater coil remains on until the water temperature in the tank rises above the desuperheater coil set point ( cut-out ) temperature defined above. The dead band temperature difference must be greater than 0 ??C and less than or equal to 20 ??C. If this field is left blank, the default value is 5 ??C.

Desuperheater water heating coils are typically used to offset energy consumption by the water tank s heater (element or burner). Therefore, the cut-in temperature for the desuperheater coil (set point minus dead band temperature difference) is usually higher than the set point temperature for the heater (element or burner) in the associated water heater tank object. At times when the water heater tank set point temperature is greater than the cut-in temperature of the desuperheater coil, the model disables the desuperheater coil and the tank s heater is used to heat the water.";

The one exception to this 0.3 limit is a source that is a condenser that is part of a detailed refrigeration system. In a detailed refrigeration system, the portion of the rejected heat that lies within the superheated region is explicitly calculated.

The bi-quadratic curve uses the coil inlet water temperature and outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (entering the DX coil condenser) as the independent variables. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated heat reclaim recovery efficiency to give the heat reclaim efficiency at specific operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point temperatures. If this field is left blank, the heat reclaim efficiency remains constant (curve value assumed to be 1.0 for all conditions).

This control object supports several different types of DX cooling coils (see field Cooling Coil Object Type).

This component may be used as a cooling coil in constant volume or variable volume systems, as blow through or draw through, with or without humidity controls. Unlike AirLoopHVAC:Unitary system types, this component controls only the DX coil, not the supply fan. CoilSystem:Cooling:DX is added to a system by placing it in an air loop branch (see Branch object) or in an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList or in a ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit:EquipmentList . It requires one or more setpoint manager (see SetpointManager:*) objects to specify temperature and/or humidity setpoints (unless it is used in a ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit which has its own temperature setpoints). This object is the one that is listed in the Branch or equipment list object rather than the coil itself. A constant volume or variable volume fan is modeled separately from this cooling system. These are the only fan types allowed for this system type (ref. Fan:ConstantVolume and Fan:VariableVolume). Cycling fan operation is not available with this model. The CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object can also be placed on dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) airloop branches or in arloop branches where the air flow to capacity ratio range is between 100 300 cfm/ton. 100% DOAS DX cooling coils operate in lower flow to capacity ratio range compared to regular DX cooling coils. The CoilSystem:Cooling:DX is selected to operate in DOAS application or in low flow to capacity ratio range by specifying YES to the input field Use Outdoor Air DX Cooling Coil . If this optional input field is left blank or specified as NO , then the coil is modeled as regular DX cooling coil. If the CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object is in an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList or in a ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit:EquipmentList then it is treated as 100% DOAS DX cooling coil only if the choice input field Use Outdoor Air DX Cooling Coil is set too YES . All the control options of the regular DX cooling coils are available to DOAS DX coils as well. Heating DX coils in DOAS airloop operate at the same flow to capacity ratio limits as the DOAS DX cooling coils.

		public static string Note = @"The heat exchanger-assisted DX cooling coil is a virtual component consisting of a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil and an air-to-air heat exchanger as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-of-the-coilsystem-cooling-dx} below. The air-to-air heat exchanger pre-conditions the air entering the cooling coil, and reuses this energy to post-condition the supply air leaving the cooling coil. This heat exchange process improves the latent removal performance of the cooling coil by allowing it to dedicate more of its cooling capacity toward dehumidification (lower sensible heat ratio).

This compound object models the basic operation of an air-to-air heat exchanger in conjunction with a cooling coil. The heat exchanger-assisted DX cooling coil does not have an operating schedule of its own; its operating schedule is governed by the availability schedules for the DX cooling coil and the air-to-air heat exchanger. This compound object is used in place of where a DX cooling coil object would normally be used by itself.

To model a heat exchanger-assisted DX cooling coil, the input data file should include the following objects:



  CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted object

  Air-to-air heat exchanger object (HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate, HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent, or HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow)

  DX cooling coil object (Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed or Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed)


In terms of controlling the operation of the heat exchanger, the heat exchanger is assumed to always provide its heat transfer when the associated DX cooling coil is operating and no high humidity control mechanism is specified. However, the heat exchanger s energy transfer may be controlled (i.e., turned on and off) based on a zone air humidity level using either a humidistat (ref. AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool or AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool) or a humidistat and a maximum humidity set point manager to place a humidity ratio set point on the appropriate control node (ref. CoilSystem:Cooling:DX). This model may also be used with the unitary changeover bypass system and the unitary air-to-air heat pump system (ref. AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool:VAVChangeoverBypass and AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir); however, the heat exchanger is assumed to always provide its heat transfer when the cooling coil operates and cannot be turned on and off based on a zone air humidity set point. Two zone air conditioners may also use this model for improved dehumidification. The first type is the packaged terminal heat pump (ref. ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump) where the heat exchanger s heat transfer is always active whenever the cooling coil operates. The second type is the window air conditioner (ref. ZoneHVAC:WindowAirConditioner) where the heat exchanger s heat transfer is always active when the cooling coil operates and no high humidity control mechanism is specified, OR the heat exchanger s heat transfer may be controlled based on zone air humidity level if a humidistat and high humidity set point manager are specified (maximum humidity ratio set point placed on the heat exchanger s exhaust air outlet node, ref. Figure~\ref{fig:schematic-of-the-coilsystem-cooling-dx}).

Links to the cooling coil and air-to-air heat exchanger specifications are provided in the input data syntax for this compound object. A description of each input field for this compound object is provided below.

The air-to-air heat exchanger precools the air entering the cooling coil, and reuses this energy to reheat the supply air leaving the cooling coil. This heat exchange process improves the latent removal performance of the cooling coil by allowing it to dedicate more of its cooling capacity toward dehumidification (lower sensible heat ratio).

This compound object models the basic operation of an air-to-air heat exchanger in conjunction with a chilled-water cooling coil. The heat exchanger-assisted water cooling coil does not have an operating schedule of its own; its operating schedule is governed by the availability schedules for the chilled-water cooling coil and the air-to-air heat exchanger. Heat exchange will occur whenever the heat exchanger is available to operate (via its availability schedule) and a temperature difference exists between the two air streams -- there is currently no method to enable or disable heat exchange based on zone air humidity level. This compound object is used in place of where a chilled-water cooling coil object would normally be used by itself.

The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.

The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 < = PLR < 1), the following rules apply:

PLF > = 0.7 and PLF > = PLR

If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.

A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:


       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)


If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:


       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)

The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.

The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 < = PLR < 1), the following rules apply:

PLF > = 0.7 and PLF > = PLR

If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.

A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:


       PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)


If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:


       PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)

The performance curves should be generated from the heat pump Reference Unit data. This is an equation-fit model that resembles a black box with no usage of heat transfer equations. On the other hand, the model uses the bypass factor approach to calculate sensible heat transfer rate, similar to the one used in the single-speed DX coil. The number of speed levels can range from 2 to 10. The cooling coil has four node connections, i.e.~two air sides and two water sides. The user needs to specify a nominal speed level, at which the gross rated total cooling capacity, rated volumetric air and water flow rates are sized. The rated capacity, rated volumetric flow rates represent the real situation in the air and water loops, and are used to determine and flow rates at various speed levels in the parent objects, e.g.~AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:WaterToAir and ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump. It shall be mentioned that the performance correction curves, i.e.~the temperature and flow fraction correction curves, should be normalized to the capacity and flow rates at each individual speed and at the rated conditions, similar to the performance curves used in the DX coils. However, the performance values, e.g.~gross capacities, gross COPs, gross SHRs and flow rates at individual speed levels, should be given regarding a specific unit from the Reference Unit catalog data. In the following content, the statement started with Reference Unit means the actual Reference Unit catalog data. The rated conditions for obtaining the capacities, COPs and SHRs are at indoor dry-bulb temperature of 26.67 ??C (80 ??F), wet bulb temperature of 19.44 ??C (67 ??F), and the source side entering water temperature of 29.4 ??C (85 ??F). Some equations are provided below to help explain the function of the various performance curves and data fields.

The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep for Speed 1.

For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 < = PLR < 1), the following rules apply:

The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the effective EIR for a given simulation timestep for Speed 1. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 < = PLR < 1), the following rules apply:

PLF > = 0.7 and PLF > = PLR

If PLF < 0.7, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0. A typical part load fraction correlation would be:


PLF = 0.85 + 0.15 \times PLR


If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:


PLF = 0.85 + 0.0 \times PLR";

    { 
		public static string Name = @"Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed:ThermalStorage";
		public static string Note = @"This object models a special direct expansion (DX) cooling coil that includes methods of storing thermal energy within the cooling coil package. This packaged thermal storage cooling coil model includes all of the equipment needed to charge and discharge and the Thermal Energy Storage (TES) tank itself. This coil object is used with CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object and a constant volume supply fan, but all other subcomponents are contained within the package.

Some types of devices may have a process air cooling section that actually has two coils, one an evaporator and the second some other kind of coil that cools by discharging the TES tank. There may also be two separate heat engines inside the package with two compressors. The model wraps these complexities inside of the model which considers just one process air cooling section that combines both types of coils and one heat rejection condenser section that rejects heat from both engines. The operating modes that are likely to have two heat engines offer dual sets of rating points and performance curves to model the energy and capacity implications separately.

The model offers various modes of operation that can be controlled over time using either a schedule or EMS actuators. The user can choose which of the five operating modes are present in the device. Each of the modes has its own separate set of performance characteristics and curves and the model can change abruptly from one mode to the next. For example when using the schedule control, the TES coil can be put into Charge Only Mode for some number of hours at night, operated in Cooling Only Mode during the mild morning hours, and run in Discharge Only Mode during the hottest part of the day. Custom control routines can be programmed using EMS to obtain a dynamic, supervisory control algorithm.



  Off Mode. This mode is always present. Although the coil will not do any cooling, the state of the TES tank is still modeled since it can continue to exchange heat with the surrounding ambient air.

  Cooling Only Mode. This mode is where the coil cools air at the evaporator using a model that is very similar to the regular, single speed DX cooling coil. The same five performance curves are used to describe cooling capacity and electric power use. The sensible heat ratio is described using two performance curves in the same as is available for 100% outdoor air coils. The TES tank is neither charged or discharged but it continues to exchange heat with the surrounding ambient air.

  Cooling And Charge Mode. This mode is where the coil both cools air at the evaporator and cools the TES tank at the same time. The model supports separate performance characteristics when there two separate heat engines, one for evaporator cooling and one for charging the TES tank.

  Cooling and Discharge Mode. This mode is where the coil cools process air and heat is rejected to both the condenser section and the TES tank at the same time. The model supports separate performance characteristics when there two separate heat engines, one for evaporator cooling and one for TES cooling.

  Charge Only Mode. This mode is where the coil charges the TES tank but does not provide any cooling at the process air cooling section.

  Discharge Only Mode. This mode is where the coil cools process air by discharging the TES tank.


This cooling coil can be autosized. The cooling capacity for the cooling only mode is sized to meet the air system s final design cooling capacity. The cooling capacity for the other modes, and the storage capacity, can all be scaled relative to that one capacity using sizing factors that can be input by the user.

Secondary coil refers to a condenser of a DX system or a heat pump in cooling operating mode or an evaporator of a heat pump in heating mode. The secondary coil (e.g.~condenser) of DX system or heat pumps is commonly installed outdoor but when installed inside a zone either heat is dumped to or extracted from a secondary zone. A secondary zone is a conditioned or unconditioned zone where the secondary coil is installed. Secondary coils are not standalone DX coils but they are add-on features on existing DX coil objects. A secondary DX coil is modeled by specifying additional inputs in one of the following DX coil objects: Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed, Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed, Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed, Coil:Cooling:DX:MultiSpeed, and Coil:Heating:DX:MultiSpeed. These additional inputs allow us to model the heat rejected or extracted by the secondary coil while the primary (active) coil is serving another controlled zone as shown in \protect\hyperlink{SecondaryCoilsFigure1}{Figure}. A secondary coil is not controlled directly but responds to the requirements of the primary DX coil. Heat is rejected or extracted depending on the primary DX coil operating modes. For instance, heat rejected to a secondary zone by a condenser of a DX system or a heat pump is considered as sensible only whereas the energy extracted from a secondary zone may contain sensible and latent components.

Figure: Schematic of DX System and heat pump in cooling operating mode

Applications of this technology include: inter-zone heat pump in NTED (Dixon, 2010), and PTAC or PTHP serving Offices attached to a Warehouse, where the office partially or fully enclosed by the warehouse and the condenser is inside the Warehouse. Heat rejected or extracted by the secondary DX coil installed in a secondary zone is estimated from the DX coil models and it is considered as internal gains of the secondary zone. The capacity and electric power input of the DX system and heat pumps are determined from the operating modes of the primary cooling or heating DX coils. Calculation of a secondary coil tracks the operating modes of the primary DX coil serving the primary conditioned zone(s). Currently allowed DX coil models are single speed, two speed and multi speed DX Systems and Heat Pumps. To model secondary DX coils the condenser type should be AirCooled. There is no need to specify the condenser air inlet node. The model uses zone air node as the secondary coil air inlet node. And the fuel type in multispeed DX coils should Electricity.

{Cooling Operating Mode}: the primary DX cooling coil of a DX system serving a primary zone is active and heat is rejected by the secondary coil (condenser) into a secondary zone. The secondary zone name is specified in DX cooling coil objects. This operating mode applies to a DX cooling system and cooling operating mode of air-to-air single and multi-speed heat pumps. Heat rejected by a secondary coil (condenser) calculated at each time step becomes internal gain of the secondary zone as shown in \protect\hyperlink{SecondaryCoilsFigure2}{Figure}. Whenever a secondary zone name is specified in DX cooling coil objects, the secondary DX coil model calculation is invoked. The only input field required to invoke the secondary DX coil in cooling operating model is to add a zone name in the input field {Zone Name for Condenser Placement} in the DX cooling coil object.

Optional inputs for the curve minimum and maximum may be used to limit the output of the performance curve (e.g., limit extrapolation). The equation is:


\Delta {P_{fan,tot}} = {C_1}*Q_{fan}^2 + {C_2}*Q_{fan}^{} + {C_3}*Q_{fan}^{}*\sqrt {{P_{sm}} - {P_o}}  + {C_4}*\left( {{P_{sm}} - {P_o}} \right)


where \Delta P_{fan,tot} is the fan total pressure rise (Pa) as a function of volumetric flow through the fan (Q_{fan}, m^3/s ), duct static pressure set point (P_{sm} , Pa), and static pressure surrounding the ducts (P_o , Pa). P_o is assumed to be zero.

The first term of the curve looks like the common system curve in which the fan pressure rise is proportional to the square of the fan flow, but here it also depends implicitly on supply and return pressure losses, and in part on the fraction of the fan flow that is outdoor air (essentially ``leaks'' into and out of the return side of the system). Very often it is the only term considered, but that would only be correct with fixed-position dampers, no distribution system leakage, no linear resistance components, and no duct static pressure control.

The second term accounts for significant flow resistances in the system where the pressure difference is linearly proportional to the flow. Some filters and coils in the return may need this term to be adequately described. This term could be ignored if there are no linear components or if their pressure drops are very small compared to the other terms.

The third term, which depends on the fan flow and square root of the supply duct pressure {P_{sm}}, accounts in part for leakage from the supply system when damper positions are fixed or are changed independently of static pressure or fan flow. In this case, reducing or eliminating supply leakage results in a different system curve. This, however, might be only a minor correction to the simple system curves generally used. The third term is zero when the VAV box dampers are modulated to control flow. Consequently, with variable-position supply dampers, reducing or eliminating supply leakage does not change the system curve.

The last term also accounts in part for leakage from the supply system when damper positions are fixed or are changed independently of static pressure or fan flow. This term indicates that the same fan pressure rise can be achieved by raising the duct pressure and closing dampers. The only change in the system in such a case is that the leakage flow may increase. The coefficient for this term is one when the VAV box dampers are modulated to control flow. In both cases, this term may be the most important correction to the simple system curves generally used, especially at low flows.

SingleSetpoint - For the SingleSetpoint scheme, the plant loop is controlled to a single temperature setpoint. This requires a setpoint manager with Control Variable = Temperature to place a setpoint on the Loop Temperature Setpoint Node. The setpoint will be stored in the Node%TempSetpoint variable which may be reported using Output:Variable System Node Setpoint Temperature. Examples of applicable setpoint managers include: SetpointManager:Scheduled, SetpointManager:OutdoorAirReset, SetpointManager:FollowOutdoorAirTemperature, etc. SingleSetpoint is the default.

DualSetpoint - For the DualSetpoint scheme, the plant loop is controlled to stay between a pair of high and low temperature setpoints. This requires one or two setpoint managers to place two setpoints on the Loop Temperature Setpoint Node. The setpoints will be stored in the Node%TempSetPointHi and Node%TempSetPointLo variables which may be reported using Output:Variable System Node Setpoint High Temperature and System Node Setpoint Low Temperature. There is special setpoint manager, SetpointManager:Scheduled:DualSetpoint, which will place both the high and low setpoints with Control Variable = Temperature. Otherwise, two setpoint managers are required, one with Control Variable = MaximumTemperature and another with Control Variable = MinimumTemperature. The two setpoint managers may be the same kind or different, but care should be taken so that the MinimumTemperature is not set higher than the MaximumTemperature. Examples of applicable setpoint managers include: SetpointManager:Scheduled, SetpointManager:OutdoorAirReset, SetpointManager:FollowOutdoorAirTemperature, etc. Note that DualSetpoint is used only for plant loops with both heating and cooling supply equipment, such as a water loop heat pump system. When the loop temperature rises above the MaximumTemperature setpoint, then the loop will request cooling, and when the loop temperature is below the MinimumTemperature setpoint it will request heating. DualSetpoint cannot be used to control a single-mode loop, such as a hot water heating loop between operating between high and low boiler setpoints.

The plant loop demand calculation scheme determines the amount of heating or cooling necessary to bring the temperature of the Plant Loop to its setpoint(s). When this value is determined then the load distribution scheme explained in the previous section takes this value and distributes the load to the appropriate equipment. The demand calculation scheme determines how the load is calculated. See more information in the Engineering Document.";

The three options are ``{None}'', ``{CommonPipe}'' and ``{TwoWayCommonPipe}''. ``{None}'' means that there is no secondary loop and the plant loop is modeled as a single primary loop. ``{CommonPipe}'' means that the common pipe interface does not attempt any temperature control, it only satisfies secondary (demand side) flow requests. ``{TwoWayCommonPipe}'' allows control of the secondary (demand side) inlet temperature or the primary (plant side) inlet temperature by placing a setpoint on the corresponding node. If this field is left blank, it will default to ''None''.

		public static string Note = @"This chiller model, developed through the CoolTools??? project sponsored by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG\&E), is an empirical model similar to EnergyPlus' Chiller:Electric:EIR model. The model uses performance information at reference conditions along with three curve fits for cooling capacity and efficiency to determine chiller operation at off-reference conditions. The model has the same capabilities as the Chiller:Electric:EIR model, but can potentially provide significant accuracy improvement over the Chiller:Electric:EIR model for variable-speed compressor drive and variable condenser water flow applications. Chiller performance curves can be generated by fitting manufacturer's catalog data or measured data. Performance curves developed from manufacturer's performance data are provided in the EnergyPlus Reference DataSets (Chillers.idf and AllDataSets.idf). This chiller model can be used to predict the performance of various chiller types (e.g., reciprocating, screw, scroll, and centrifugal) with water-cooled condensers.

The main difference between this model and the Chiller:Electric:EIR model is the condenser fluid temperature used in the associated performance curves: the Chiller:Electric:ReformulatedEIR model uses the LEAVING condenser water temperature while the Chiller:Electric:EIR model uses the ENTERING condenser water temperature.

Note: Chiller:Electric:Reformulated EIR objects and their associated performance curve objects are developed using performance information for a specific chiller and should almost always be used together for an EnergyPlus simulation. Changing the object input values, or swapping performance curves between chillers, should be done with extreme caution. For example, if the user wishes to model a chiller size that is different from the reference capacity, it is highly recommended that the reference flow rates be scaled proportionately to the change in reference capacity. Although this model can provide more accurate prediction than the Chiller:Electric:EIR model, it requires more performance data to develop the associated performance curves (at least 12 points from full-load performance and 7 points from part-load performance).

(2) Type Lift is based on the normalized lift, which is the temperature difference between the leaving condenser water temperature and the leaving evaporator water temperature.";

The form of this curve is based on the input for Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Type.

For the type of LeavingCondenserWaterTemperature, the curve object type should be Curve:Bicubic or Table:TwoIndependentVariables that parameterizes
the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the leaving condenser water temperature.

For the type of Lift, the curve object type should be Curve:ChillerPartLoadWithLift or Table:MultiVariableLookup that parameterizes the variation of EIR
as a function of the normalized fractional Lift, normalized Tdev and the PLR. Tdev is the difference between Leaving Chilled Water Temperature and Reference Chilled Water Temperature.
Lift is the difference between the Leaving Condenser Water Temperature and Leaving Chilled Water Temperature.
The EIR is the inverse of the COP, and the part-load ratio is the actual cooling load divided by the chiller's available cooling capacity.
This curve is generated by dividing the operating electric input power by the available full-load capacity (do not divide by load) at the specific operating temperatures.
The curve output should decrease from 1 towards 0 as part-load ratio decreases from 1 to 0.
The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference full-load EIR (inverse of the reference COP) and the Energy Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve
to give the EIR at the specific temperatures and part-load ratio at which the chiller is operating.
This curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference leaving condenser water temperature with the part-load ratio equal to 1.0.
An ideal chiller with the same efficiency at all part-load ratio's would use a performance curve that has a value of 0 when the part-load ratio equals 0
(i.;e., a line connecting 0,0 and 1,1 when plotted as EIRfTPLR versus PLR), however, actual systems can have part-load EIR's slightly above or below this line
(i.e., part-load efficiency often differs from rated efficiency). The bicubic curve should be valid for the range of condenser water temperatures
and part-load ratios anticipated for the simulation (otherwise the program issues warning messages).

Note: Although a bicubic curve requires 10 coefficients (ref. Curve:Bicubic), coefficients 7, 9 and 10 are typically not used in the performance curve described here and should be entered as 0 unless sufficient performance data and regression accuracy exist to justify the use of these coefficients.

The heat pump has a reciprocating compressor that serves both the hot water and the chilled water loop. Note that this model is currently ``hardwired'' to fluid property R22. FluidProperties:* objects for R-22 must be included in the idf file. These may be copied from DataSets\\FluidPropertiesRefData.idf.

Descriptions and strengths of these two models are available in the following references:

Beginning with version 9.1, an EIR-formulated water-to-water heat pump model was added.  This formulation allows the user to enter curves for specifying the capacity and energy usage in a more generic way, allowing the curves to be applicable to a wide variety of components.  With the original equation fit model, the curve form was locked in to a specific set of linear coefficients.  With the new form, the curve can be a quadratic function of temperatures, or an even more generic lookup table.

The Supply side of the heat pump is usually connected to a Ground Heat Exchanger. The figure below shows the layout and piping diagram of the water-to-water heat pump.

First, the equation fit model objects are described. This model has two sets of coefficients, one for the heating mode and other for the cooling mode.

Chiller-heaters used for this particular system can be of two types: 1) standard vapor-compression, non-reversible cycle chillers designed for heat recovery or 2) reversible-cycle, water-to-water heat pump chillers. Unlike a distributed ground source heat pump configuration where individual heat pumps are located in each zone, a centralized geothermal configuration has one or more chiller-heaters. Its function is to encapsulate the extra controls needed to turn individual chiller-heater modules on/off and whether they are to operate in cooling-only, heating-only or simultaneous cooling-heating mode and whether to connect the source water to the evaporator or condenser side. A variety of control schemes can be designed by setting schedules for both zone control types and individual chiller-heaters schedules.

The fluid used in this central system is usually water, and there is no sharing of condenser or evaporator water between multiple machines. However, the control logic is such that the source water can be delivered to individual chiller-heaters depending on their operating mode, e.g., modules in simultaneous cooling-heating mode receive no source water, modules in heating-only mode can have source water directed to their evaporator, or modules in cooling-only mode can have source water directed to their condenser; the decision on which module(s) receives the source water dictated by the `smart' controls. The following figures illustrate node interconnections between this central geothermal application and plant and condenser loops in various situations.

The order of the multiple chiller-heaters' operation is assumed to be sequential. In other words, the very first chiller-heater will be called at first to see if it meets all loads that the central heat pump system should meet. If the chiller-heater meets all loads, the rest chiller-heaters are assumed to be turned off. If not, the following chiller-heater will be called to meet the remaining loads until all loads are met in the order as defined in the set of individual chiller-heater objects below. The order of individual chiller-heater modules needs to be carefully arranged in case users are intended to see the performance of various combinations of different sizes of chiller-heaters in a central heat pump system.

(To model cold thermal storage integrated with packaged air-conditioning units, see the thermal storage cooling coil in section \ref{coilcoolingdxsinglespeedthermalstorage}.  The four cold thermal storage objects for plant loops are:



  ThermalStorage:Ice:Simple

  ThermalStorage:Ice:Detailed

  ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Mixed

  ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Stratified


These objects are typically placed on the supply side of a primary chilled water loop in series or in parallel with one or more chillers.~ Using the the component set point (PlantEquipmentOperation:ComponentSetpoint) plant operation scheme type, the chiller and storage tank setpoints are used to control operation. Using a SetpointManager:Scheduled object (or other appropriate type of set point manager), the setpoints on the chiller outlet node and the ice storage outlet node can be used to control how the cooling load is shared and when charging of storage occurs.~ Example setpoints to use for various modes of operation are shown in the table below:

\begin{longtable}[c]{p{3.0in}p{1.5in}p{1.5in}}
\toprule
Mode & Chiller Setpoint & Storage Setpoint \tabularnewline

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Example files have been developed for three common storage configurations:

1.~Series -- Chiller Upstream:~ In this configuration, a chiller is placed first on the same branch as the storage unit.

2.~Series -- Chiller Downstream:~ In this configuration, a chiller is placed second on the same branch as the storage unit.


\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}


  Parallel:~ In this configuration, the chiller is on a branch parallel to the storage unit branch when it is not charging.~ During charging mode, valves will be changed so that the chiller is in series upstream of the storage.~ To accomplish this in EnergyPlus, the chiller must be modeled using two different chiller objects to represent the same chiller.~ One chiller object on a parallel branch operates only when storage is not being charged.~ The other chiller object, in series upstream of the storage unit operates only during charging mode.


Other considerations for applying cold thermal storage objects include:



  In the PlantLoop object, the ``Minimum Loop Temperature'' must be set equal to or less than the lowest setpoint to be used anywhere in the loop.

  To end the storage charging cycle, use a AvailabilityManager:LowTemperatureTurnOff to shut off the primary chilled water loop when the temperature leaving the storage tank nears the charging mode chiller setpoint indicating that the tank is fully charged.~ For example, if the chiller is set to provide --5C chilled water during charging, then charging can be shut down when the water temperature leaving the storage unit reaches --4C.~ When using a primary-secondary loop arrangement, it may be necessary to schedule this availability manager to be active only when the HVAC systems are off to avoid fighting between the demand controls and the availability manager.

These systems are modeled using the ``OutsideMelt'' option.~ For systems that have a charging process that does not vary significantly with fraction charged can ignore this input by accepting the default value.~ The default value for this field is ``OutsideMelt''.

This field references a separate pressure head curve that the user has input separately in the input file. The pressure curve represents a non-dimensional regression of pressure-flow rate data. The equation should be of the following form:


\psi  = {C_4} \times {\varphi ^4} + {C_3} \times {\varphi ^3} + {C_2} \times {\varphi ^2} + {C_1} \times \varphi  + {C_0}.


In this equation, the two dimensionless parameters, X and X are defined in terms of physical pump and flow parameters as:


\psi  = \frac{{\Delta P}}{{\rho {N^2}{D^2}}}



\varphi  = \frac{{\dot m}}{{\rho N{D^3}}}


Where Delta P is the pressure drop, mdot is the fluid mass flow rate, rho is a representative fluid density, N is the rotational speed of the pump, and D is the pump impeller diameter.

Since the user may not need a full fourth order expansion of this, the user may use linear (first order), quadratic (second order), cubic (third order), or full quartic (fourth order). These are available in the objects Curve:Linear, Curve:Quadratic, Curve:Cubic, Curve:Quartic.

Once this curve is input properly (along with the following two fields), the pump will respond to the plant loop pressure drop when resolving the flow rate.

Control of the panel is achieved using the methodology used for low temperature radiant systems???a piecewise linear control profile that varies the flow rate to the panel based on a control parameter defined by the user.  This is different than being controlled to meet any remaining load like the air-based systems.  However, due to the radiant nature of these devices, it is not possible to control precisely on a zone air-based load since this will result in overcooling at the next time step.  Despite this, in addition to the piecewise linear controls that have been used with low temperature radiant systems in the past, two new controls are available for this simple model: one that varies the convective output of the system to meet the remaining zone load and one that varies the total convective output of the system to meet the remaining zone load.  In these two zone load control types, the user must enter the typical zone thermostat object to replace the setpoint and throttling range input in this object.

The temperature denoted in the setpoint schedule can refer to one of five different temperatures: the zone mean air temperature, the zone mean radiant temperature, the zone operative temperature, the outdoor dry-bulb temperature, or the outdoor wet-bulb temperature.  The current field controls the choice of temperature.  For controls that are based more on zone load, the user can make one of two choices based on whether the zone load is met by only the convective output of the unit or the total output of the unit.  These zone load controls will not perform as precisely as air-based systems.  The convective zone load control will come close to meeting the current setpoint temperature (defined by the typical zone thermostat input by the user) since the convective output of the unit will be set to match the remaining zone load.  However, in the long run, this will likely overcool the space since radiant energy is being absorbed by surfaces and this will impact the zone conditions at later time steps.  The total zone load control will likely undercool the space in the short term since the total output (radiant and convective) of the unit will be set to meet the remaining zone load.  However, this will not fully impact the zone air temperature immediately since some of the energy is being absorbed from surfaces rather than the zone air.  The user must select from the following options:




  MeanAirTemperature

  OperativeTemperature

  OutdoorDryBulbTemperature

The cooling control temperature schedule specifies the ???setpoint??? temperature where the flow rate to the system is at half of the maximum flow rate. For example, if the cooling control temperature setpoint is currently 25 C and the cooling throttling range is 2 C, the water flow rate to the radiant system will be zero when the controlling temperature (MAT, MRT, Operative Temperature, ODB, or OWB; see control type field above) is at or below 24 C and the maximum flow rate when the controlling temperature is at or above 26 C. This represents a throttling range of 2 C around the setpoint of 25 C. In between 24 C and 26 C, the flow rate to the radiant system is varied linearly.  Note that this field is ignored when the control type is either ZoneLoadConvective or ZoneLoadTotal.

It should be noted that this control schedule will allow different setpoint temperatures throughout the year for cooling. The control of the radiant cooling panel is based solely on the cooling control throttling range listed above, the cooling control temperature schedule, and the control temperature type listed above.

For the two zone load controls, the user must use a typical zone thermostat and the system output will be dependent on the remaining zone load.";
		public static string Field_CondensationControlType = @"Since radiant cooling panels provide a cold surface in what could be a humid zone, there is the possibility that condensation will occur on the surface of the panel. This is due to the fact that the surface temperature may drop below the dew-point temperature of the space. When this occurs, condensation on the surface will occur. Since there is no direct calculation of the surface temperature of the radiant cooling panel, the condensation check will be made at the inlet water temperature to the panel. Since the user can utilize the next parameter to adjust the differential between the dewpoint temperature and the inlet water temperature, this will allow some flexibility in controlling when the panel will shutdown to avoid condensation. There are three options for handling potential condensation: Off, SimpleOff, and VariableOff. This parameter is optional and will default to SimpleOff.



  Off - EnergyPlus will not do anything other than produce a warning message when condensation is predicted to occur. The program will simply continue on; no moisture will be removed from the zone air and there will be no adjustment of the surface temperature as a result of the condensation. 

  SimpleOff - the program will predict cases where condensation will occur and shut-off the radiant system to avoid this situation. With this option, the user also has the option to adjust when the system will shut down. This is specified with the next parameter (field: Condensation Differential Parameter).

  VariableOff - the program will attempt to reduce the inlet temperature to the panel by locally recirculating some of the water leaving the panel and mixing it with water from the overall demand side flow.  This also means that some of the demand side water will bypass the panel. In reality, this would require a pump to achieve such mixing and recirculation, but due to the simple nature of this model, no pump definition will be required. Like the SimpleOff option, the VariableOff option uses the condensation dewpoint offset parameter to adjust when the system will try to adjust for the possibility of condensation.";
		public static string Field_CondensationControlDewpointOffset = @"This optional parameter is only valid with the SimpleOff and VariableOff condensation handling algorithm (see previous input parameter). It establishes the difference between the calculated dew-point temperature of the space and the allowed inlet water temperature to the radiant cooling panel before the system shuts down in degrees Celsius. This parameter can be any positive, negative, or zero value. When this parameter is zero, the radiant system will shut down or recirculate water (depending on whether SimpleOff or VariableOff is used) when the inlet temperature drops to the dew-point temperature or below. When this parameter is positive, the radiant system will shut down or recirculate water when the inlet water temperature is the number of degrees Celsius above the dew-point temperature. This allows some extra safety to avoid condensation. When this parameter is negative, the radiant system will shut down or recirculate water when the inlet water temperature is the number of degrees Celsius below the dew-point temperature. This strategy allows the user to simulate a situation where small amounts of condensation are tolerable or the resistance of the panel from the water loop to the panel surface is being taken into account as condensation would likely happen at the panel surface. The default value for this parameter is 1??C.";
		public static string Field_FractionRadiant = @"This field allows the user an opportunity to characterize the heat tranfser at the surface of the panel as either purely radiative, purely convective, or some combination of radiant and convective.  As a result, through this parameter, EnergyPlus gives the user an opportunity to characterize the zone temperature as a function of the zone mean radiant temperature and the mean air temperature.  The performance of the unit is proportional to the difference between the water inlet temperature and the zone temperature where the zone temperature is found using a weighted average of zone mean radiant temperature and mean air temperature.  The weighting factor is this parameter, and it is multiplied by the zone mean radiant temperature.  The remainder of the zone temperature calculation is made up of the zone mean air temperature.  During modeling, it is likewise used to calculate how much of the energy being absorbed by the unit is radiant energy.  This parameter can be difficult to quantify as the fraction radiant can vary with zone conditions.  However, by definition, a radiant system like this radiant cooling panel exchanges at least half of its energy to the zone via radiation.  One study has shown that a fraction radiant between 0.6 and 0.7 is a reasonable estimation.

Note that the sum of all of the surface radiant energy fractions plus the radiant fraction from people must add up to unity just like in the radiant-convective baseboard models.  Note that there is a small possibility that a particular surface listed in these pairs is actually lower than the temperature of the panel.  This probably will not happen unless there is another cooling surface within the zone.  In reality, absorbing net radiant energy from a colder surface would violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  However, in keeping with the simple nature of this model, EnergyPlus will monitor the inlet water temperature to the panel and produce a warning message if this temperature is lower than any of the surface temperature of the surfaces with which this system is interacting.

There are three options for handling this situation: Off, SimpleOff, and VariableOff. This parameter is optional and will default to SimpleOff.



  Off - EnergyPlus will not do anything other than produce a warning message when condensation is predicted to occur. The program will simply continue on, no moisture will be removed from the zone air, and there will be no adjustment of the surface temperature as a result of the condensation.

  SimpleOff - the program will predict cases where condensation will occur and shut-off the radiant system to avoid this situation. With this option, the users also have the opportunity to adjust when the system will shut down. This is specified with the next parameter (field: Condensation Control Dewpoint Offset). 

  VariableOff - the program will determine whether condensation is predicted for the flow rate determined by the unit control scheme.  If condensation is predicted, the unit makes one attempt to reduce the flow rate using linear interpolation between the controlled flow rate and a zero flow rate to achieve a surface temperature that would match the dew-point temperature modified by the condensation control dew-point offset (field: Condensation Control Dewpoint Offset). For example, if the controlled flow rate results in a surface temperature of 10??C, a zero flow rate results in a surface temperature of 12??C, and the modified condensation dew-point temperature is 11??C, then the reduced flow rate would be half of the controlled flow rate.

This parameter can be any positive, negative, or zero value. When this parameter is zero, the radiant system will shut down or reduce the flow rate when the surface temperature drops to the dew-point temperature or below. When this parameter is positive, the radiant system will shut down or reduce the flow rate when the surface is the number of degrees Celsius above the dew-point temperature. This allows some extra safety to avoid condensation. When this parameter is negative, the radiant system will shut down or reduce the flow rate when the surface temperature is the number of degrees Celsius below the dew-point temperature.

		public static string Note = @"This low temperature radiant system (hydronic) is a component of zone equipment that is intended to model any ``radiant system'' where water is used to supply/remove energy to/from a building surface (wall, ceiling, or floor). The component is controlled via control schedules as described in the syntax below and does not require a zone thermostat. Note that because this unit does not require a thermostat that in cases where no other systems are serving the zone in which this system resides that it will use the heating equipment priority to determine which system will run first.~ If the radiant system is serving a zone with forced air equipment, the radiant system will follow the priority order established by the zone thermostat but will still base its response on the controls defined by the user for the radiant system.

The constant flow system differs from the hydronic system describe above in what it controls. The hydronic system varies the flow rate through the radiant system based on some control temperature. The constant flow system keeps flow rate constant via a local circulation pump and varies the water temperature that is sent to the radiant system. This is accomplished with a mixing valve that is controlled by a sensor. This model covers a wide range of low temperature radiant systems: heating and/or cooling, panel or embedded pipes, etc. It is not intended to simulate high temperature electric or gas radiant heaters. Those devices will be handled by a separate model and different input syntax. Low temperature radiant systems that use electric resistance heating should also be defined using separate input syntax (ref: ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:Electric). Low temperature radiant systems that vary the flow rate through the radiant system should also be defined using separate input syntax (ref: ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:VariableFlow)

One of the other differences between this model and the variable flow hydronic radiant system is that the constant flow radiant system has a built-in local secondary loop. It will recirculate flow coming out of the system and mix this with flow from the loop to arrive at the desired inlet temperature to the radiant system (note that this model has the temperature sensor AFTER the pump to insure proper inlet temperature to the radiant system). The local loop also contains a pump which is assumed to be upstream of the radiant system and after the mixing valve. So, the local loop can have some recirculation. The flow from the main loop may also bypass the radiant system if more than enough flow is available and the main loop is also a constant flow system.

There are three options for handling this situation: Off, SimpleOff, and VariableOff. This parameter is optional and will default to SimpleOff.



  Off - EnergyPlus will not do anything other than produce a warning message when condensation is predicted to occur. The program will simply continue on; no moisture will be removed from the zone air and there will be no adjustment of the surface temperature as a result of the condensation.

  SimpleOff - the program will predict cases where condensation will occur and shut-off the radiant system to avoid this situation. With this option, the users also have the opportunity to adjust when the system will shut down. This is specified with the next parameter (field: Condensation Control Dewpoint Offset).

  VariableOff - the program will determine whether condensation is predicted for the flow rate determined by the unit control scheme.  If condensation is predicted, the unit makes one attempt to avoid condensation by increasing the water inlet temperature to the system to match the dew-point temperature modified by the condensation control dew-point offset (field: Condensation Control Dewpoint Offset). For example, if a surface in the space is predicted to be 15??C and the modified condensation dew-point temperature is 17??C, then the inlet water temperature to the unit is reset to 17??C and the system is simulated again with this new inlet water temperature.  If this increased inlet water temperature does not result in condensation, then the simulation continues using this operating condition for the system.  If the increased inlet water temperature still results in condensation, then the unit is turned off to avoid excessive iterations.";

This parameter can be any positive, negative, or zero value. When this parameter is zero, the radiant system will shut down or adjust the inlet water temperature when the surface temperature drops to the dew-point temperature or below. When this parameter is positive, the radiant system will shut down or increase the inlet water temperature when the surface is the number of degrees Celsius above the dew-point temperature. This allows some extra safety to avoid condensation. When this parameter is negative, the radiant system will shut down or increase the inlet water temperature when the surface temperature is the number of degrees Celsius below the dew-point temperature.

A dehumidification component placed upstream of this node can then use the humidity ratio setpoint to control its moisture removal rate (e.g., desiccant dehumidifiers).

This setpoint manager is used to establish a temperature setpoint at the mixed air node. The Controller:OutdoorAir then operates the outdoor air damper to attempt to meet this setpoint.

In EnergyPlus the relief and outdoor air dampers, the economizer, and any outdoor air conditioning equipment form a separate subsystem of an air loop system (ref. AirLoopHVAC). The outdoor air controller operates within the subsystem. Consequently the mixed air temperature setpoint must take into account any downstream system fan heat if it is to meet a desired system supply air leaving temperature. The Mixed Air Setpoint Manager accomplishes this by referencing a supply air setpoint set by another setpoint manager (most likely at the AirLoopHVAC outlet node). The supply fan inlet and outlet nodes are also inputs to the Mixed Air Setpoint Manager. From this information the Mixed Air Setpoint Manager calculates the supply fan air temperature rise, subtracts it from the reference setpoint temperature, and sets the result as the mixed air node setpoint temperature.

Of course any type of setpoint manager can be used to establish a temperature setpoint at the mixed air node. But the Mixed Air Setpoint Manager is likely to be the most useful.

When optional inputs of Cooling Coil Inlet Node Name, Cooling coil Outlet Node Name, and Minimum Temperature at Cooling Coil Outlet Node are provided, the setpoint temperature at the mixed air node is calculated based on the maximum of both the reference setpoint temperature and minimum cooling coil outlet temperature, minus the cooling coil air temperature reduction and the supply fan air temperature rise if the supply fan placement is blow through. The setpoint temperature at the mixed air node is used to calculate the maximum outdoor air flow fraction in the corresponding Controller:OutdoorAir object. The outdoor air flow fraction is capped at the maximum outdoor air flow fraction to prevent the cooling coil from freezing, even though the fraction is below the minimum outdoor air flow fraction.

Connections between the air distribution unit, the supply air duct, and the zone are specified in the input syntax for the air distribution unit and the AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter. The input syntax also explicitly defines an outlet identifier. This implies a connection to a zone through a NodeList for zone inlets (see the ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections statement). The air distribution unit is limited to one combined component-controller unit; because controls are normally based on the zone thermostat and can work in parallel or series in complex fashion. Since the control and the flow resolution can be complex, each air distribution unit is unique in addressing these combinations and therefore only one is allowed per zone.

The Air Distribution unit also allows the user to specify leaks in the supply air duct system. These inputs are used in the EnergyPlus Simplified Duct Leakage Model (SDLM). This model simulates a specific configuration: supply leaks to a return plenum in a commercial VAV or CV system. The system must have a constant static pressure setpoint. Within these limitations SDLM allows the user to easily evaluate the energy penalty due to duct leakage.

		public static string Note = @"The simplest piece of zone equipment is the ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystem component. ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystem is used in situations where the user wishes to study the performance of a building without modeling a full HVAC system. In such a case, the Ideal Loads Air System is usually the sole conditioning component: the user does not need to specify air loops, water loops, etc. All that is needed for the ideal system are zone controls, zone equipment configurations, and the ideal loads system component. The use of a return plenum is optional and will require use of the AirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenum object.

This component can be operated with infinite or finite heating and cooling capacity. For either mode -- infinite or limited capacity -- the user can also specify on/off schedules for heating and cooling and outdoor air controls. There are also optional controls for dehumidification, humidification, economizer, and heat recovery. This component may be used in combination with other HVAC equipment serving the same zone.

This component can be thought of as an ideal unit that mixes air at the zone exhaust condition (or plenum outlet condition when a plenum is attached) with the specified amount of outdoor air and then adds or removes heat and moisture at 100% efficiency in order to produce a supply air stream at the specified conditions. The energy required to condition the supply air is metered and reported as DistrictHeating and DistrictCooling.

{Notes:} The ideal loads system uses the zone return node or an optional zone exhaust node to extract air from the zone. When the AirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenum is used the inlet of the ideal loads system is connected to the plenum outlet air node while the outlet of the ideal loads system is connected to a zone inlet node. The node name connected between the zone exhaust air node and plenum inlet air node must match in the ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections and AirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenum objects. Every zone served by an HVAC component must have a return air node, even though this node may not be connected to anything. If more than one ideals loads air systems are connected to the same AirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenum then one of the ideal loads air systems will connect to the ZoneHVAC:ReturnPlenum outlet air node and the remaining ideal loads air systems connected to the same return plenum will connect to the ZoneHVAC:ReturnPlenum induced air outlet nodes.

The ideal loads system was significantly expanded in version 7.0 (October 2011). As part of this upgrade, any change in the moisture content of the supply air stream results in a latent cooling (dehumidification) or latent heating (humidification) load which is metered as DistrictCooling and DistrictHeating energy consumption. Prior to version 7.0, when the ideal loads system was in heating mode, only the energy for sensible heating was metered. This results in significant changes in reported energy use compared to earlier versions, especially when using the {{ConstantSupplyHumidityRatio}} option for Humidification Control Type.

Older idf files which are transitioned to version 7.0 will automatically be set to use the {{ConstantSupplyHumidityRatio}} option for both dehumidification and humidification controls, because this is equivalent to the controls used in the older version of this system. However, the user should review all of the humidity control options and select the one which best reflects the goal of the simulation.

    { 
		public static string Name = @"ZoneHVAC:FourPipeFanCoil";
		public static string Note = @"What is a fan coil unit? Like many HVAC terms, ``fan coil unit'' is used rather loosely. Sometimes it is used for terminal units that would be better described as powered induction units. Carrier and others use the term for the room side of refrigerant-based split systems. Here we are modeling in-room forced-convection hydronic units. The hydronic heating coil may be replaced with an electric heating coil. Typically these units are small (200 -- 1200 cfm) and self-contained. They are mostly used in exterior zones, usually in hotels, apartments, or offices. They may be connected to ducted outside air, or have a direct outside air vent, but they do not have outside air economizers. Units with outside air economizers are marketed (in the United States) as unit ventilators. Unit ventilators are typically bigger than fan coils and are widely used in classrooms or other applications where ventilation is a priority. If a zonal unit with an outside economizer is desired, {ZoneHVAC:UnitVentilator} should be used.

The heating or cooling output of the fan coil unit is controlled by varying the air flow rate, the water flow rate, or both. Air flow rate can be controlled by cycling the fan on/off or with a variable speed fan drive. The most common setup is a two or three speed fan with the speed selected by hand. The fan then cycles on/off to control heating / cooling output. The controls are often a wall mounted thermostat with hand selection of heating/cooling and fan speed (off/low/medium/high). These controls may also be mounted on the unit.

Carrier offers a retrofit VSD motor for fan coil units. It claims up to 45% energy savings from such a retrofit, as well as increased comfort and less noise compared to a cycling fan (fan coil fans are typically noisy and inefficient). Some other manufacturers are also offering units with VSD fans. Variable speed fans appear to offer an easy way to significantly increase the efficiency of what have typically been very inefficient units.

EnergyPlus provides 6 capacity control methods for this unit:


\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

  multi-speed cycling fan with constant water flow rate

  constant speed continuous fan with variable water flow rate

  variable-speed fan with constant water flow rate

  variable-speed fan with variable water flow rate

  multi-speed fan with cycling between speeds and constant water flow.

  fan speed control based on ASHRAE 90.1


In EnergyPlus the fan coil units are modeled as compound components. That is, they are assembled from other components. Fan coils contain an outdoor air mixer, a fan, a heating coil and a cooling coil. These components are described elsewhere in this document. The fan coil input simply requires the names of these four components, which have to be described elsewhere in the input. The input also requires the name of an availability schedule, maximum airflow rate, outdoor airflow rate, and maximum and minimum hot (for hydronic heating coil only) and cold water volumetric flow rates. The unit is connected to the zone inlet and exhaust nodes and the outdoor air by specifying unit inlet, and outlet air node names and the outdoor air mixer object name. The outdoor air mixer child object provides the outdoor air and relief air nodes names. Note that the unit air inlet node should be the same as a zone exhaust node and the unit outlet node should be the same as a zone inlet node. The fan coil unit is connected to a hot water loop through its hot water coil or with no hot water loop when using an electric coil (demand side) and to a chilled water loop (demand side) through its cooling coil.

Note that the type of fan component associated with the fan coil unit depends on the type of capacity control method chosen. For {ConstantFanVariableFlow~} a {Fan:OnOff} or {Fan:ConstantVolume} should be used. For {CyclingFan}, a {Fan:OnOff} should be used, for {VariableFanVariableFlow} or {VariableFanConstantFlow} a {Fan:VariableVolume}, for {MultiSpeedFan} a {Fan:OnOff} should be used, and for {ASHRAE90VariableFan}, a {Fan:OnOff} or {Fan:VariableVolume} should be chosen.

Fan coil units can be 4-pipe or 2-pipe. For 4-pipe units there are 2 supply pipes and 2 return pipes. For 2-pipe units there is a single supply pipe and a single return pipe and the supply is switched between hot and chilled water depending on the season. EnergyPlus models 4-pipe units, but the 4-pipe model can be used to model 2-pipe~units by using the coil availability schedules to make sure that either hot or chilled water is exclusively available. Fan coil units with hydronic heat can instead be modeled using an electric heating coil if desired (i.e., replace the hydronic heating coil with an electric heating coil).

		public static string Field_CapacityControlMethod = @"This input denotes how the unit's output is controlled in order to meet zone heating or cooling requirement. The choices are {{ConstantFanVariableFlow}}, {{CyclingFan}}, {{VariableFanVariableFlow}}, {{VariableFanConstantFlow}}, {{MultiSpeedFan}}, or {{ASHRAE90VariableFan}}. For {ConstantFanVariableFlow}, the fan speed is held constant to produce a fixed air flow rate whenever the unit is scheduled on. The hot water or chilled flow rate is varied so that the unit output matches the zone heating or cooling requirement. For {CyclingFan}, the fan speed is chosen so that the unit capacity is greater than or equal to the heating / cooling load and the fan is cycled to match unit output with the load. For {VariableFanVariableFlow} ~both air and water flow rates are varied to match the load. For {VariableFanConstantFlow,} the water flow rate is at full flow and the fan speed varies to meet the load. For {MultiSpeedFan} the water flow rate is at full flow when there is load or fully closed when there is no load and the supply air flow rate is varied by varying the fan speed in order to match the load. For {ASHRAE90VariableFan}, the fan air flow rate is reduced according to the low speed supply air flow ratio when the zone sensible load is less than the zone sensible load multiplied by the low speed supply air flow ratio. The water coil water flow rate, or the electric heating coil part-load ratio, is modulated to meet the zone load. If the zone sensible load is greater than the zone sensible load multiplied by the low speed supply air flow ratio, then the air and water flow rate is increased to meet the load. If the zone load is greater than the design sensible load, the fan air flow rate is maintained at the maximum value while the water flow rate is further increased to the maximum available while electric heating coils are maintained at the maximum output.

{{Note: when ASHRAE90VariableFan is selected, if the the Minimum Supply Air Temperature in Cooling/Heating Mode inputs are not specified, the simulation must include zone sizing to calculate the zone design sensible cooling and heating load used to modulate the fan speed and, for water coils, the water flow rate or for electric heating coils, the part load ratio.}}

{{MultiSpeedFan:}} for a given load, the fan cycles between speeds when fan speed selected is higher than the minimum speed or the fan cycles on-off when the fan speed selected is the minimum and the fan operating schedule is cycling fan. When the fan is operating as a continuous fan, then the fan runs at minimum speed even when there is no load to meet. When the speed selected is higher than the minimum speed, then the fan cycles between consecutive speed regardless of the fan operating schedule type. The model selects at what fan speed to run depending on cooling or heating load.";

	public static class ZoneHVACUnitVentilator
    { 
		public static string Name = @"ZoneHVAC:UnitVentilator";
		public static string Note = @"Unit ventilators are zone equipment units which are assembled from other components. They contain a built-in outdoor air mixer, a fan, a heating coil, and a cooling coil. These components are described elsewhere in this document, except the built-in outdoor air mixer which is contained within the unit ventilator statement. The unit ventilator input simply requires the names of these other three components, which have to be described elsewhere in the input. The input also requires the name of an availability schedule, maximum airflow rate, outdoor air control information (control type and schedules), an outdoor airflow rate, and maximum and minimum hot and cold water mass flow rates. The unit is connected to the zone inlet and exhaust nodes and the outdoor air by specifying unit inlet, outlet, outdoor air and exhaust (relief) air node names. Note that if the Unit Ventilator is not connected to central dedicated outdoor air (DOA), then the unit air inlet node should be the same as a zone exhaust air node and the unit air outlet node should be the same as a zone air inlet node. The three node name input fields: {Outdoor Air Node Name}, {Exhaust Air Node Name}, and {Mixed Air Node Name} are required fields only when the built-in outdoor air mixer is used to provide outdoor air. If the Unit Ventilator is connected to a central dedicated outdoor air (DOA) via {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer}, then the above three node name input fields are not required and must be left blank. In the later case the Unit Ventilator node connection to the zone air exhaust node and the zone air inlet node are described in {AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer} object. In general, the unit ventilator input is very similar to the fan coil unit input, and the unit is connected to a hot water loop (demand side) through its hot water coil and to a chilled water loop (demand side) through its cooling coil.

The main difference between the fan coil and unit ventilator input is that the unit ventilator has a built-in outdoor air mixer with its own specialized controls. The outdoor air control type can be selected from one of the following options: ``variable percent'', ``fixed temperature'' or ``fixed amount''. In fixed temperature control, the amount of outdoor air is varied between the minimum outdoor air fraction (specified by a schedule) and 100% outdoor air to obtain a mixed air temperature as close as possible to the temperature schedule defined in the input. Variable percent control will also vary the amount of outdoor air between the minimum and maximum fractions (both specified in input by the user) to meet the load without the use of a coil if possible. In fixed amount control, the outdoor air flow rate is fixed to the specified value by the user. In this control strategy, the maximum outdoor air flow rate and schedule are automatically set to be equal to the minimum outdoor air flow rate and schedule. These control types are based on the 2004 ASHRAE Systems and Equipment Handbook (pp.~31.1-31.3) description of unit ventilator systems. The three outdoor air control strategies are also valid and available when the Unit Ventilator is connected to central DOA.

The unit is controlled to meet the zone (remaining) heating or cooling demand. If there is a heating demand, the cooling coil is off and the hot water flow through the heating coil is throttled to meet the demand. The hot water control node must be specified (same as the hot water coil inlet node). If there is a cooling demand from the zone, the hot water coil is off and the chilled water flow through the cooling coil is throttled to meet the load. The cooling coil control node must be specified (same as the cooling coil inlet node). Finally both heating and cooling require a convergence tolerance, which is the tolerance denoting how closely the fan coil unit will meet the heating or cooling load. The tolerance is always relative to the zone load.

Overall, control of the unit must consider the outdoor air. Here is a more detailed description of the overall unit control:

{Off:} Unit is schedule off or there is no load on it. All flow rates are set to zero and the temperatures are set to zone conditions (except for the outdoor air inlet). Outdoor air requirements will not override this condition.

{Heating/No Coil/VariablePercent:} The unit is on, there is a heating load, no heating coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and variable percent outdoor air control type has been specified. In this case, the variable percent outdoor air controls what happens with the outdoor air. If the outside temperature is greater than the return temperature, then the outdoor air is set to the maximum as defined by the user input. If the outdoor air temperature is less than the return temperature from the zone, then the outdoor air is set to the minimum outdoor air flow rate as defined by the user. Since a coil is not present to further condition the supply air, the zone simply receives whatever temperature air results from the outdoor air controls.

{Heating/No Coil/FixedTemperature:} The unit is on, there is a heating load, no heating coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and fixed temperature has been specified. The unit ventilator tries to use outdoor air as best as possible to meet the temperature goal. If it cannot meet this goal because the temperature goal is not between the zone return temperature and the outdoor air temperature, then the unit ventilator will either use the maximum or minimum outdoor air flow rate.

{Heating/No Coil/FixedAmount:} The unit is on, there is a heating load, no heating coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and fixed amount control has been specified. The unit ventilator fixes the outdoor air flow rate as defined by the user and sets the maximum and minimum outdoor air flow rate to be equal in order to avoid the variation of outdoor air flow rate between the maximum and minimum values. Since a coil is not present to further condition the supply air, the zone simply receives whatever temperature air results from the outdoor air controls.

{Heating /With Coil/VariablePercent:} The unit is on, there is a heating load, and variable percent control is specified. The outdoor air fraction is set to the minimum outdoor air fraction (schedule based), and the heating coil is activated. The heating coil attempts to meet the remaining load on the zone being served by the unit ventilator.

{Heating /With Coil/FixedAmount:} The unit is on, there is a heating load, a heating coil is present and is scheduled on, and fixed amount control has been specified. The unit ventilator fixes the outdoor air flow rate as defined by the user and sets the maximum and minimum outdoor air flow rate to be equal in order to avoid the variation of outdoor air flow rate between the maximum and minimum values. The heating coil then attempts to meet any remaining zone heating load.

{Cooling/No Coil/VariablePercent:} The unit is on, there is a cooling load, no coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and variable percent outdoor air control type has been specified. In this case, the variable percent outdoor air controls what happens with the outdoor air. If the outside temperature is greater than the return temperature, then the outdoor air is set to the minimum as defined by the user input. If the outdoor air temperature is less than the return temperature from the zone, then the outdoor air is set to the maximum outdoor air flow rate as defined by the user. This may be somewhat simplistic in that it could result in overcooling of the space. However, since a temperature goal was not established, this is the best that can be done by the simulation. Since a coil is not present to further condition the supply air, the zone simply receives whatever temperature air results from the outdoor air controls.

{Cooling/No Coil/FixedTemperature:} The unit is on, there is a cooling load, no cooling coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and fixed temperature has been specified. The unit ventilator tries to use outdoor air as best as possible to meet the temperature goal. If it cannot meet this goal because the temperature goal is not between the zone return temperature and the outdoor air temperature, then the unit ventilator will either use the maximum or minimum outdoor air flow rate in the same fashion as the variable percent outdoor air control.

{Cooling/No Coil/FixedAmount:} The unit is on, there is a cooling load, no cooling coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and fixed amount control has been specified. The unit ventilator fixes the outdoor air flow rate as defined by the user and sets the maximum and minimum outdoor air flow rate to be equal in order to avoid the variation of outdoor air flow rate between the maximum and minimum values. Since a coil is not present to further condition the supply air, the zone simply receives whatever temperature air results from the outside air controls.

{Cooling/With Coil/VariablePercent:} The unit is on, there is a cooling load, a coil is present and is scheduled on, and variable percent outdoor air control type has been specified. In this case, the percentage of outdoor air is set to the minimum flow outdoor air flow rate. The coil then attempts to meet any remaining zone load.

{Cooling/With Coil/FixedTemperature:} The unit is on, there is a cooling load, a cooling coil is present and is scheduled on, and fixed temperature has been specified. The unit ventilator tries to use outdoor air as best as possible to meet the temperature goal. If it cannot meet this goal because the temperature goal is not between the zone return temperature and the outdoor air temperature, then the unit ventilator will either use the maximum or minimum outdoor air flow rate in the same fashion as the fixed temperature outdoor air control for the ``no coil'' conditions. The cooling coil then attempts to meet any remaining zone load.

{Cooling/With Coil/FixedAmount:} The unit is on, there is a cooling load, a cooling coil is present and is scheduled on, and fixed amount control has been specified. The unit ventilator fixes the outdoor air flow rate as defined by the user and sets the maximum and minimum outdoor air flow rate to be equal in order to avoid the variation of outdoor air flow rate between the maximum and minimum values. The cooling coil then attempts to meet any remaining zone cooling load.

Note: the unit ventilator controls are strictly temperature based and do not factor humidity into the equation (not an enthalpy economy cycle but rather a simple return air economy cycle). In addition, temperature predictions are not strict energy balances here in the control routine though in the mixing routine an energy balance is preserved.

In general, the variable percent control will attempt to vary the amount of outdoor air between some minimum and maximum schedules of fractions (see next two fields) to best meet the current heating or cooling load. The fixed temperature control will vary the amount of outdoor air between the minimum schedule (fraction of maximum, see next field) and 100% available outdoor air to come as close as possible to a desired mixed air temperature (see 2 fields down) that can be scheduled. The fixed amount control will fix the outdoor air flow rate as minimum outdoor air flow rate and schedule specified by the user and automatically set the maximum and minimum outside flow rate to be equal by ignoring the maximum outdoor air flow rate.

		public static string Note = @"Unit heaters are zone equipment units which are assembled from other components and are a simplification of unit ventilators. They contain only a fan and a heating coil. These components are described elsewhere in this document. The unit heater input simply requires the names of these components, which have to be described elsewhere in the input. The input also requires the name of an availability schedule, maximum airflow rate, and maximum and minimum hot water volumetric flow rates. The unit is connected to the zone inlet and exhaust nodes by specifying unit inlet and outlet node names. Note that the unit air inlet node should be the same as a zone exhaust node and the unit outlet node should be the same as a zone inlet node.

While the control of the heating coil is similar to the fan coil units and the unit ventilator, the overall control of the unit heater is much different. There are four different modes in which a unit heat can operate based on the user input:

{Off:} Unit is schedule off. All flow rates are set to zero and the temperatures are set to zone conditions.

{NoLoad OR Cooling/''No''} is specified in input field ``Supply Air Fan Operation During No Heating''{:} Unit is available, but there is no heating load. With ``No'' specified for ``Supply Air Fan Operation During No Heating'' and the supply fan operating mode set to 0, the fan will be off since there is no heating load. All flow rates are set to zero and the temperatures are set to zone conditions.

{NoLoad OR Cooling/''Yes''} is specified in input field ``Supply Air Fan Operation During No Heating''{:} Unit is available, the supply fan operating mode schedule value is greater than 0 (for OnOff Fan) and the fan is running (if it is scheduled to be available also). No heating is provided, only air circulation via the fan running. However, any heat added by the fan is introduced into the space with the circulation of the air.

{Heating:} The unit is on/available and there is a heating load. The heating coil is modulated (constant fan speed) to meet the heating load. When the fan type is not an OnOff fan then the~ control of the heating coil and its flow rate is identical to the fan coil unit. In the case of OnOff fan, the fan cycles with heating coil if the current timestep supply fan operating mode is schedule value is 0, or else if the current timestep supply fan operating mode schedule value is greater than 0, then the supply fan runs continuously for the entire timestep.

The unit is controlled by matching the unit output to the zone demand. For units with water coils, the model must be numerically inverted to obtain a specified output.

This field allows the user some control over how closely the heat pump will control the air-side conditions. The relative size of this parameter relates directly to the closeness of the control. A very small value in this field will result in tight control and will probably result in larger numbers of iterations. A large value in this field will result in looser controls and could result in unsatisfactory fluctuations in zone air temperature. Initial experience with this parameter lends to the recommendation of using 0.001 as the starting point.

The heat pump is controlled by matching its sensible (temperature) cooling output to the zone sensible load (demand). Because the performance of the DX cooling coil is frequently non-linear, the heat pump model must call the DX cooling coil model several times (iterate) to determine the proper run time fraction to meet the zone load. The cooling convergence tolerance is the error tolerance used to terminate the iteration procedure when the following equation is satisfied:


\frac{{\left| {({Q_{ZoneLoad}} - {Q_{HeatPump,out}})} \right|}}{{{Q_{ZoneLoad}}}}\,\, \le \,\,Cooling{\kern 1pt} Convergence{\kern 1pt} Tolerance

{Cycling} varies water flow through the coil based on the heat pump Part Load Ratio. This control method is appropriate for modeling heat pumps that are outfitted with a soleniod valve which allows water to flow through the coil only when the compressor is active. This is the default for EnergyPlus V8 and later.

{Constant} provides a constant water flow regardless of heat pump operation. Remember that EnergyPlus has two coils (a heating coil and a cooling coil) to approximate the operation of one coil that can operate in either heating mode or cooling mode. Therefore, when the water flow mode is constant, there will be full flow through either the heating coil or the cooling coil, but not both at the same time.

{ConstantOnDemand} provides full flow through the coil whenever there is a load. When there is no load, there is zero flow through the coil.~ This control strategy represents the way EnergyPlus modeled heat pump water flow prior to Version 8.";

Generally, a ''hybrid`` is any system that exhibits both continuous and discrete dynamic behavior ??? a system that can both flow (as could be described by a differential equation) and jump (as must be described by distinct modes). Equipment in this category may utilize a wide variety technologies including, but not limited to: indirect evaporative cooling, desiccant dehumidification, heat recovery, vapor compression, adsorption, or ventilation cooling. Each hybrid system packages multiple technologies into a single integrated system. There are a multitude of unique hybrid system architectures, and each unique system may have numerous unique operating modes.

\end{figure}

ZoneHVAC:HybridUnitaryHVAC is a black-box model designed to allow empirical representation of a wide variety of hybrid unitary systems. The model does not require information about internal system architecture, however it requires extensive data to describe the performance of a product in every operating mode. The model is intended for packed forced air equipment and can represent unitary systems that consume electricity, water, and up to two additional fuel types.

Uncontrolled independent variables include outdoor and indoor air temperature and humidity ratio. Controlled independent variables include: operating mode, supply air flow rate, outdoor air fraction, and part runtime fraction. Dependent variables include supply air temperature, supply air humidity, electricity use, fuel uses, water use, fan electricity use, and external static pressure. Empirical data tables (see Table:MultiVariableLookup) are required to map each dependent variable in each discrete operating mode. The model can accommodate up to 26 discrete operating modes, including a standby mode. Each mode is limited to operate within independently specified ranges of indoor and outdoor psychrometric conditions.  The standby mode is not limited by either indoor or outdoor psychrometric conditions.

ZoneHVAC:HybridUnitaryHVAC is structured as a constrained optimization problem ??? in each time step the model will choose one or more combinations of the controlled independent variables so as to best provide the predicted sensible load, the predicted latent load, and the scheduled zone ventilation requirement, with the least amount of resource consumption.

A setting is defined as any unique combination of mode, outdoor air fraction, and supply air flow rate. The system may operate with multiple settings in each time step. The portion of each time step spent in a setting is described as the part runtime fraction for that setting. During any time step that the combination of settings can satisfy all of the soft constraints with part runtime fractions that sum to less than one, the system will operate in a standby mode (Mode 0) for the remainder of the timestep. If no combination of settings will satisfy all of  the soft constraints the system will choose the combination of settings that most nearly satisfies all soft constraints. If the indoor and outdoor psychrometric conditions are beyond the constraints that limit each operating mode, or if no setting will satisfy all constraints on supply air temperature and absolute humidity, the system will operate in standby mode (Mode 0).
